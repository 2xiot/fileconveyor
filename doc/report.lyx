Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This bachelor thesis is about improving Drupal's page loading performance
 through integrating Drupal with a CDN.
 Page loading performance is about reducing the time it takes to load a
 web page.
 Because reducing that time also reduces the time required to access information
, increases the number of satisfied visitors, and if the web site is commercial,
 it increases revenue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you can prove that improvements are made, you need a tool to measure
 that.
 So first, a comparison is made of available page loading performance profiling
 tools (and related tools).
 Episodes is chosen because it is the only tool that measures the real-world
 page loading performance.
 This requires tight integration with Drupal though, so a module was written
 to integrate Episodes with Drupal.
 A companion module to visualize the collected measurements through basic
 charts was also written.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, a daemon was written to synchronize files to a CDN (actually, any
 kind of file server).
 It was attempted to make the configuration as self-explanatory as possible.
 The daemon is capable of processing the file before it is synced, for example
 to optimize images or compress CSS and JavaScript files.
 A variety of transporters (for different protocols) is available to transport
 the file to file servers.
 According to the configuration file, files are detected through the operating
 system's file system monitor and then processed and transported to their
 destination servers.
 The resulting URLs at which the files are available are stored in a database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, a Drupal module was written that makes it easy to integrate Drupal
 with a CDN (both with and without the daemon).
 A patch for Drupal core had to be written to make it possible to alter
 the URLs to static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, and so on).
 To make this functionality part of the next version of Drupal core, a patch
 for that version was also submitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, a test case was built.
 A high-traffic web site with a geographically dispersed audience was migrated
 to Drupal and the Episodes integration was enabled.
 The first period, no CDN integration was enabled.
 Then the daemon was installed and CDN integration was enabled.
 Files were being synced to a static file server in Belgium and a North-American
 CDN, and visitors were assigned to either one, based on their geographical
 location.
 This second period, with CDN integration enabled, was also measured using
 Episodes and conclusions were drawn from this.

Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I wrote a custom proposal for a bachelor thesis, it was quickly approved
 by my promotor, Prof.
 dr.Wim Lamotte.
 I would like to thank him for making this bachelor thesis possible.
 He also approved of writing this thesis in the open, to get feedback from
 the community and to release all my work under the GPL, which will hopefully
 ensure it will be used.
 I have worked to the best of my abilities to try to ensure that my work
 can be used in real world applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the creation of this bachelor thesis, I have often received very
 useful feedback from my mentors, Maarten Wijnants and Stijn Agten.
 My sincere thanks go to them.
 I would also like to thank

Het doel van deze bachelorproef is het verbeteren van de

 van Drupal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang dutch
Drupal is een systeem om websites mee te bouwen en is bedoeld voor zowel
 ontwikkelaars als eindgebruikers: het voorziet zowel uitgebreide API's
 als een rijk ecosysteem aan kant-en-klare modules, die kunnen gedownload
 en geïnstalleerd worden in minder dan een minuut.
 Het is geschreven in PHP, omdat die taal op de meeste servers beschikbaar
 is en één van de doelstellingen van Drupal is om op zoveel mogelijk servers
 te werken.
 Zo is het aantal potentiële gebruikers het grootst, want het maakt het
 gebruik van Drupal goedkoper.
 Drupal is er ook op gericht om zoveel mogelijk te innoveren en om de laatste
 trends te volgen — of er op vooruit te lopen.
 Het is een volwassen open source software project dat wordt gebruikt door
 vele bekende instanties, waaronder de Belgische overheid, Disney, de NASA,
 Harvard university en de Verenigde Naties.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Honderdduizenden websites gebruiken Drupal.
 Het verbeteren van de page loading performance van Drupal kan dus een effect
 hebben op een groot aantal websites.
 Een van de meest effectieve methodes om de page loading performance te
 verbeteren, is het gebruik van een CDN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang dutch
Een CDN is een verzameling van webservers die verspreid staan over meerdere
 locaties om gegevens efficiënter af te leveren bij gebruikers.
 De server die geselecteerd wordt om gegevens aan een specifieke gebruiker
 te leveren wordt meestal gedaan op basis van de afstand in het netwerk,
 waarbij dichterbij beter is.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Er zijn twee soorten CDN wat betreft het plaatsen van bestanden op de CDN:
 push en pull.
 Pull vereist vrijwel geen werk: URLs moeten aangepast worden, waarbij de
 domeinnaam van de CDN geplaatst wordt waar voorheen de domeinnaam van de
 website stond.
 De CDN downloadt dan vanzelf de bestanden die het moet verzenden aan de
 gebruiker van de server van de website.
 Dit wordt de 
\emph on
Origin Pull
\emph default
 techniek genoemd.
 Anderzijds zijn er ook CDNs die een push-mechanisme ondersteunen, waarbij
 door middel van bijvoorbeeld FTP de bestanden op de CDN kunnen geplaatst
 worden.
 De CDN downloadt dus niet vanzelf de bestanden, die moeten er door de eigenaar
 van de website op geplaatst worden.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Mijn doelstelling was om drie soorten CDN's te ondersteunen:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\lang dutch
iedere CDN die Origin Pull ondersteunt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\lang dutch
iedere CDN die FTP ondersteunt

\begin_layout Enumerate

\lang dutch
Amazon S3/CloudFront, dit is een specifieke CDN met een eigen protocol.
 Omdat deze zo populair is, heb ik er voor gekozen om deze ook expliciet
 te ondersteunen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang dutch
Dit lijken de de drie meest gebruikte soorten CDN's te zijn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang dutch
Page loading performance gaat over het minimaliseren van de tijd die nodig
 is om een webpagina in te laden.
 Want snellere websites betekent tevredenere bezoekers die vaker terugkomen
 en, indien je website commercieel is, meer omzet.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Zo wezen bijvoorbeeld tests van Google uit dat een halve seconde extra tijd
 om zoekresultaten te laden, een vermindering van twintig procent van het
 aantal zoekacties met zich meebracht.
 Amazon merkte dat iedere honderd milliseconde aan extra tijd om een webpagina
 in te laden in een daling van één procent van het aantal verkopen resulteerde.
 Als je dan nog weet dat het helemaal niet uitzonderlijk is om laadtijden
 van vijf seconden en meer te hebben, wordt al snel duidelijk dat de impact
 groot kan zijn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang dutch
Om te garanderen dat mijn pogingen om de page loading performance van Drupal
 te verbeteren, was het echter noodzakelijk om de resultaten te kunnen meten.
 Na het analyseren van een brede waaier aan page loading performance profiling
 tools (en gerelateerde tools), werd het al snel duidelijk dat Episodes
 (dit was slechts een prototype, geschreven door Steve Souders — dit is
 de persoon die het fenomeen page loading performance en het nut van het
 optimaliseren ervan, bekend heeft gemaakt) was de beste kandidaat: het
 is de enige tool die de mogelijkheid heeft om de wérkelijke page loading
 performance te meten, omdat het metingen doet in de browser van iedere
 bezoeker van de website, bij iedere paginaweergave.
 De gemeten episodes worden door middel van een GET request en een uitgebreide
 query string naar een Apache server gelogd naar een Apache log.
 Deze tool heeft bovendien ook het potentieel om dé standaard te worden
 in de loop van de komende jaren.
 Het is zelfs niet ondenkbaar dat het ingebouwd zal worden in toekomstige
 browsers.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Om het te gebruiken in mijn bachelorproef, heb ik de code opgekuist en het
 klaar gemaakt (of tenminste bruikbaar) voor gebruik op een Drupal website,
 via een nieuwe Drupal module: de Episodes module.
 Deze integratie gebeurt op zo'n manier dat alle 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Drupal behaviors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (dit zijn alle JavaScript 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

behaviors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (gedragingen) die gedefinieerd worden door middel van een vastgelegde Drupal
 JavaScript API) automatisch worden gemeten.
 Alles dat de eigenaar van de website moet doen, is enkele veranderingen
 in zijn Drupal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

theme
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (letterlijk: thema, het design van de website dus) aan te brengen om er
 voor te zorgen dat al dat wat kan gemeten worden, ook effectief gemeten
 wordt.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Deze module is klaar voor gebruik in productie.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang dutch
Ik heb tevens een bijbehorende Episodes Server module gemaakt.
 Via deze module is het mogelijk om de logs die verzameld zijn door middel
 van Episodes te importeren en de metingen te visualiseren door middel van
 grafieken (gegenereerd aan de hand van Google Chart API).
 Dankzij deze grafieken kan je de werkelijke page loading performance over
 een tijdspanne evalueren.
 Het is zelfs mogelijk om de page loading performance van meerdere landen
 tegelijk te vergelijken met de globale page loading performance.
 Het laat je ook toe om te zien welke episodes momenteel het langst duren
 en dus het best geschikt zijn voor optimalisatie.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Deze module is nog niet klaar voor gebruik in productie, maar het is een
 goede basis om van te beginnen.
 De code die de logs in de database importeert, werkt gegarandeerd dankzij
 unit tests.

Dan is er natuurlijk de daemon om bestanden te synchroniseren.
 Dit was het belangrijkste deel van deze bachelorproef.
 Hoe raar het ook mag lijken, er lijkt niets vergelijkbaar te bestaan, of
 tenminste niet publiekelijk beschikbaar (zelfs geen commerciële programma's).
 Als het zou bestaan, zou ik het zeker al vernomen hebben van een van de
 tientallen mensen die op de hoogte zijn van het concept en doel van mijn
 bachelorproef.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Ik ben begonnen met het ontwerp van het configuratiebestand.
 De configuratie van de daemon gebeurt door middel van een XML bestand dat
 is ontworpen om gemakkelijk te zijn in gebruik, op voorwaarde dat je bekend
 bent met de terminologie.
 Verscheidene mensen die zich thuis voelen in de terminologie werden gevraagd
 om een voorbeeld configuratiebestand te bekijken en ze antwoordden meteen
 dat het logisch in elkaar zat.
 Het is belangrijk dat dit gemakkelijk is, want het is de interface naar
 de daemon toe.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

De daemon werd gesplitst in grote componenten en ik ben begonnen met de
 eenvoudigste, omdat ik dit zou schrijven in Python, een taal die ik nooit
 eerder had gebruikt.
 Ik heb voor deze taal gekozen omdat volgens de geruchten het je leven als
 programmeur een stuk makkelijker zou maken, deels dankzij de beschikbaarheid
 van modules voor vrijwel alles dat je je kan inbeelden.
 Gelukkig bleek dat grotendeels waar te zijn, hoewel ik wel lange tijd gevreesd
 heb dat ik alle code voor het transporteren van bestanden (transporters)
 zelf zou moeten gaan schrijven.
 Dat zou een vrijwel onmogelijke opdracht geweest zijn, gegeven de hoeveelheid
 tijd.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Dit is dan ook de reden waarom de daemon eigenlijk eenvoudigweg een verzameling
 Python modules is.
 Deze modules kunnen in eender welke applicatie gebruikt worden, bijvoorbeeld
 de 
\family typewriter
fsmonitory.py
\family default
 module — die bestandssysteem monitors op verschillende besturingssystemen
 abstraheert en zo een cross-platform API creëert — kan makkelijk hergebruikt
 worden in andere applicaties.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Dus heb ik een relatief grote verzameling Python modules geschreven: 
\family typewriter
config.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
daemon_thread_runner.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
filter.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor.py
\family default
 (met een subclass voor ieder ondersteund besturingssysteem), 
\family typewriter
pathscanner.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
persistent_list.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
persistent_queue,py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
processor.py
\family default
 (met een verzameling subclasses, één voor iedere processor) en 
\family typewriter
transporter.py
\family default
 (met subclasses die zeer dunne wrappers rond Django custom storage systems
 zijn).
 Telkens indien het haalbaar was, heb ik unit tests geschreven.
 Maar omdat er in deze applicatie veel bestand I/O en netwerk I/O aan te
 pas komt, was dit vaak extreem complex om te doen en dus overgeslagen,
 ook omdat de hoeveelheid beschikbare tijd beperkt was.
 Voor 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor
\family default
 ondersteuning in Linux kon ik verder bouwen op de 
\family typewriter
pyinotify
\family default
 module en voor de transporters zag ik de mogelijkheid om Django's custom
 storage systems geheel te hergebruiken, waardoor ik zonder al te veel moeite
 ondersteuning heb voor FTP, Amazon S3 en 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Symlink or Copy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (een speciaal custom storage system, om verwerkte bestanden ook te kunnen
 synchroniseren met Origin Pull CDNs).
 Django is een framework om websites mee te bouwen (in tegenstelling tot
 Drupal is het énkel geschikt voor developers) en daarvan heb ik dus één
 API (en zijn dependencies) hergebruikt.
 Het gevolg is dus dat veranderingen die gemaakt worden aan de transporters
 in de daemon, weer kunnen worden teruggegeven en vice versa.
 Ik heb enkele bugfixes doorgegeven die reeds goed bevonden zijn en nu dus
 deel uitmaken van die code.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Dit heeft een interessant neveneffect: 
\family typewriter
arbitrator.py
\family default
, de module die al deze op zich zelf staande modules samenbindt tot één
 geheel (die dus arbitreert tussen de verscheidene modules), kan eenvoudig
 compleet gerefactored worden.
 Hoewel het bijna duizend regels code is (maar veel regels daarvan zijn
 commentaar), kan men eenvoudig de hele arbitrator herschrijven, omdat het
 enkel logica bevat die de losse modules aan elkaar linkt.
 Dus indien er bijvoorbeeld een bottleneck zou gevonden worden die zich
 enkel in bepaalde situaties voordoet omwille van een fout in het ontwerp
 van de arbitrator, kan dit relatief eenvoudig opgevangen worden, omdat
 alle logica van de daemon in een enkele module zit.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Omdat het onmogelijk is om zeker te zijn dat de daemon correct en betrouwbaar
 werkt in iedere omgeving en iedere mogelijke configuratie, is het aan te
 raden dat een bedrijf eerst haar use case simuleert en verifieert dat de
 daemon zoals gewenst functioneert in die simulatie.
 Hopelijk trekt dit project voldoende mensen aan die er aan werken om het
 verder geschikt te maken voor meer situaties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang dutch
Een Drupal module om de integratie met CDNs te vereenvoudigen werd ook geschreve
n: de CDN integratie module.
 Echter, voordat deze kon geschreven worden, was het nodig om een patch
 voor Drupal core te schrijven, omdat het nodig is om de URLs naar bestanden
 te kunnen aanpassen.
 Indien deze URLs niet aanpasbaar zijn (zoals het geval is voor Drupal 6),
 kunnen ze ook niet aangepast worden om naar een CDN te verwijzen.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Een patch voor Drupal 7 (deze versie van Drupal is momenteel in ontwikkeling)
 — met unit tests want dat is een vereiste — om deze functionaliteit deel
 te laten uitmaken van Drupal in de toekomst, heeft zeer positieve reviews
 gekregen, maar moet nog steeds door het minutieuse peer review proces gaan.
 Het is zeer waarschijnlijk dat het binnenkort gecommit zal worden.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Er zijn twee modi beschikbaar in de Drupal module: eenvoudig en geavanceerd.
 In de geavanceerde modus kan enkel gebruik gemaakt worden van Origin Pull
 CDN's.
 Maar omdat het gebruiken van dit soort CDN's nu zeer eenvoudig wordt dankzij
 deze module, terwijl het vroeger een reeks manuele stappen vereiste, is
 dit alleen al erg nuttig.
 Echter, in de geavanceerde modus wordt het pas echt interessant: dan wordt
 de database van gesynchroniseerde bestanden gebruikt die door de daemon
 werd aangemaakt en wordt onderhouden.
 Dan wordt de URL van een bestand op de CDN opgezocht, waarna deze URL wordt
 gebruikt.
 Het is zelfs mogelijk om een speciale callback functie te implementeren
 die kan gebruikt worden om een specifieke server te selecteren, op basis
 van de eigenschappen van de gebruiker (locatie, type lidmaatschap of wat
 dan ook).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Deze module is ook klaar voor gebruik in productie.

\begin_layout Standard

\lang dutch
De feedback van bedrijven was teleurstellend wat betreft de hoeveelheid
 maar overweldigend positief.
 Op meer positieve feedback zou ik niet gehoopt kunnen hebben.
 Het potentieel van de daemon werd sterk gewaardeerd.
 De codestructuur van de daemon werd beschreven als 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

duidelijk en zelfverklarend
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 en de documentatie (van de daemon zelf en de beschrijving ervan in de bachelorp
roef tekst) als 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zeer duidelijk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Het zorgde er blijkbaar zelfs voor dat een reviewer er spijt van kreeg
 dat hij zijn bachelor graad niet voltooid heeft.
 Deze reviewer was zelfs zo enthousiast dat hij al begonnen was met het
 schrijven van patches voor de daemon, zodat die beter inzetbaar was in
 zijn infrastructuur.
 Dit suggereert dat het mogelijk haalbaar is dat de daemon een levendig
 open source project wordt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\lang dutch
Ten slotte bevestigden de resultaten van mijn test case de stelling dat
 het integreren van Drupal met een CDN de page loading performance kan verbetere
n.
 Hoewel de resultaten (die gelogd worden door middel van de Episodes module)
 niet zo expliciet waren als ze zouden kunnen geweest zijn voor een website
 rijk aan media (mijn test case was een website die arm was aan media),
 was het verschil nog steeds duidelijk te onderscheiden in de grafieken
 (die gegenereerd werden door de Episodes Server module).
 Ondanks het feit dat de website al geoptimaliseerd was aan de hand van
 de mechanismen die standaard in Drupal aanwezig zijn, resulteerde de integratie
 met een CDN (via de CDN integratie module en de daemon) in een duidelijke
 algemene wereldwijde verbetering van de page loading performance.

 Unlike what you might think, the majority of this time is not spent at
 the server, generating the page! The generating (back-end) and transport
 of the HTML document (front-end) is typically only 10-20% of the end user
 response time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The other 80-90% of the time is spent on loading the components (CSS stylesheet

It should be obvious now that it is far more effective to focus on front-end
 performance than it is to focus on back-end performance, because it has
 got a greater potential.
 It is also easier to optimize than the back-end, because instead of having
 to profile the entire codebase through which the page is generated (which
 is necessary for optimizing the back-end performance), you can simply change
 where in the HTML files are being referenced and possibly also replacing
 the URLs to use a CDN instead.
 These measures are clearly far more easy to implement.

 The difference between the two is that the former is a system with predefined

 The latter is — as the name already indicates — a framework which still

History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is an open source project, started in 2000 by Dries Buytaert, whom was
 then still studying at the University of Antwerp.
 He built a small news web site with a built-in web board, allowing his
 friends in the same dorm to leave notes or to announce when they were having
 dinner.
 After graduation, they decided they wanted to stay in touch with each other,
 so they wanted to keep this site online.
 Dries wanted to register the domain name 
\begin_inset Flex URL

dorp.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (the Dutch word for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

village
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), which was considered a fitting name.
 But he made a typo and registered

 such as syndication, rating and distributed authentication.
 The ideas resulting from those discussions were implemented on 
\begin_inset Flex URL

 itself.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Only later, in 2001, Dries released the software behind

 as

\end_inset

.
 The purpose was to enable others to use and extend the experimentation
 platform so that more people could explore new paths for development.
 The name Drupal, pronounced "droo-puhl," derives from the English pronunciation
 of the Dutch word "druppel," which means "drop" .

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
What makes it different?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a couple of things that separate Drupal from most other CMSes
 and CMFs.
 For starters, Drupal has a set of principles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal principles"

\end_inset

 it strictly adheres to, amongst which is this one:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Drupal should also have minimal, widely-available server-side software requireme
nts.
 Specifically, Drupal should be fully operational on a platform with a web
 server, PHP, and either MySQL or PostgreSQL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the reason PHP was chosen as the language to write Drupal in.
 PHP is the justification for some people to not even try Drupal.
 But it is also a reason why so many web sites today are running Drupal,
 and why its statistics (and the popularity of its web site) have been growing
 exponentially for years 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal.org growth,Drupal growth"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

By settling for the lowest common denominator and creating a robust, flexible
 platform on top of that, it can scale from a simple blogger (such as myself)
 to the huge media company (such as Sony BMG, Universal Music, Warner Bros,
 Popular Science, Disney, and so on), non-profit organizations (amongst
 which are Amnesty International, the United Nations and Oxfam), schools
 (Harvard, MIT and many more), even governments (including the Belgian,
 French, U.S.
 and New Zealand) and important organisations such as NASA and NATO.
 The list is seemingly endless 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal sites"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drupal is also strongly focused on innovation, and always closely follows
 (or leads!) the cutting edge of the world wide web.
 The Drupal community even has a saying for this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
the drop is always moving 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal drop is always moving"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means there will always be an upgrade from one major Drupal core version
 to the next, but it will only preserve your data, your code will stop working.
 This is what prevents Drupal from having an excessive amount of legacy
 code that many other projects suffer from.
 Each new major version contains many, often radical, changes in the APIs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Maturity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indicators of project maturity are also present: Drupal has a set of coding
 standards 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal coding standards"

\end_inset

 that must be followed strictly.
 For even the slightest deviation (a single missing space), a patch can
 be marked as 'needs work'.
 It also has a large security team 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal security team"

\end_inset

 which releases security advisories whenever a security flaw is found in
 either Drupal core or any of the contributed modules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Community
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That brings us to the final part of this brief general introduction to Drupal:
 the gold of Drupal is in its community.
 The community is in general very eager to help getting newcomers acquainted
 with the ins and outs of Drupal.
 Many people have learned their way through the Drupal APIs by helping others
 (including myself).
 The result of this vibrant community is that there is a very large collection
 of more than 4000 modules 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal modules"

\end_inset

 and more than 500 themes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 available for Drupal, albeit of varying quality.
 This is what enables even the less technically adept to build a web site
 with complex interactions, without writing a single line of code.

Page loading performance matters for a single reason:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Users care about performance!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your web site's visitors will not be timing the page loads themselves, but
 they will browse elsewhere when you are forcing them to wait too long.
 Fast web sites are rewarded, slow web sites are punished.
 Fast web sites get more visitors, have happier visitors and their visitors
 return more often.
 If the revenue of your company is generated through your web site, you
 will want to make sure that page loading performance is as good as possible,
 because it will maximize your revenue as well.

Now, why is this important to Drupal – because this bachelor thesis is about
 improving Drupal's page loading performance in particular? Because then
 the Drupal experience is better: a faster web site results in happier users
 and developers.
 If your site is a commercial one, either through ads or a store, then it
 also impacts your revenue.
 More generally, a faster Drupal would affect many:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drupal is increasingly being used for big, high-traffic web sites, thus
 a faster Drupal would affect a lot of people
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drupal is still growing in popularity (according to its usage statistics,
 which only include web sites with the Update Status module enabled, there
 are over 140,000 web sites as of February 22, 2009, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal usage statistics"

\end_inset

) and would therefor affect ever more people.
 Near the end of my bachelor thesis, on June 14, 2009, this had already
 grown to more than 175,000 web sites.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drupal is international, thanks to its internationalization and localization
 support, and thanks to that it is used for sites with very geographically
 dispersed audiences (whom face high network latencies) and developing countries
 (where low-speed internet connections are commonplace).
 A faster Drupal would make a big difference there as well.

Key Properties of a CDN
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Key-Properties-CDN"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will repeat the definition from the terminology section:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
A content delivery network (CDN) is a collection of web servers distributed
 across multiple locations to deliver content more efficiently to users.
 The server selected for delivering content to a specific user is typically
 based on a measure of network proximity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is extremely hard to decide which CDN to use.
 In fact, by just looking at a CDN's performance, it is close to impossible
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cdn-comparing-1,cdn-comparing-2"

\end_inset

!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is why CDNs achieve differentiation through their feature sets, not
 through performance.
 Depending on your audience, the geographical spread (the number of PoPs
 around the world) may be very important to you.
 A 100% SLA is also nice to have — this means that the CDN guarantees that
 it will be online 100% of the time.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

You may also choose a CDN based on the population methods it supports.
 There are two big categories here: 
\emph on
push
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
pull
\emph default
.
 Pull requires virtually no work on your side: all you have to do, is rewrite
 the URLs to your files: replace your own domain name with the CDN's domain
 name.
 The CDN will then apply the 
\emph on
Origin Pull
\emph default
 technique and will periodically pull the files from the origin (that is
 your server).
 How often that is, depends on how you have configured headers (particularly
 the 
\family typewriter
Expires
\family default
 header).
 It of course also depends on the software driving the CDN – there is no
 standard in this field.
 It may also result in redundant traffic because files are being pulled
 from the origin server more often than they actually change, but this is
 a minor drawback in most situations.
 Push on the other hand requires a fair amount of work from your part to
 sync files to the CDN.
 But you gain flexibility because you can decide when files are synced,
 how often and if any preprocessing should happen.
 That is much harder to do with Origin Pull CDNs.
 See table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Pull-versus-Push"

\end_inset

 for an overview on this.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It should also be noted that some CDNs, if not most, support both Origin
 Pull and one or more push methods.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The last thing to consider is vendor lock-in.
 Some CDNs offer highly specialized features, such as video transcoding.
 If you then discover another CDN that is significantly cheaper, you cannot
 easily move, because you are depending on your current CDN's specific features.

 Amazon S3 (or Simple Storage Service in full) is a storage service that

 It has a pay-per-use pricing model: per GB of file transfer and per GB
 of storage.

Amazon S3 is designed to be a storage service and only has servers in one

 Recently, Amazon CloudFront has been added.
 This is a service on top of S3 (files must be on S3 before they can be
 served from CloudFront), which has edge servers everywhere in the world,
 thereby acting as a CDN.

 Its tag line,

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 indicates what it is about: there are a lot of possible combinations of
 stylesheets, scripts and images.
 Plus they can be external or inline.
 And each combination has different effects.
 Finally, to further complicate the situation, all these combinations depend
 on the browser being used.
 It should be obvious that without Cuzillion, it is an insane job to figure
 out how each browser behaves:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Before I would open an editor and build some test pages.
 Firing up a packet sniffer I would load these pages in different browsers
 to diagnose what was going on.
 I was starting my research on advanced techniques for loading scripts without
 blocking and realized the number of test pages needed to cover all the
 permutations was in the hundreds.
 That was the birth of Cuzillion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cuzillion is not a tool that helps you analyze any 
\emph on
existing 
\emph default
web page.
 Instead, it allows you to analyze any combination of components.
 That means it is a 
\emph on
learning tool
\emph default
.
 You could also look at it as a 
\emph on
browser profiling tool
\emph default
 instead of all other listed tools, which are 
\emph on

\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a simple example to achieve a better understanding.
 How does the following combination of components (in the 
\family typewriter
<body>
\family default
 tag) behave in different browsers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
an image on domain 1 with a 2 second delay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
an inline script with a 2 second execution time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
an image on domain 1 with a 2 second delay
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First you create this setup in Cuzillion (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cuzillion"

\end_inset

).
 This generates a unique URL.
 You can then copy this URL to all browsers you would like to test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, Safari and Firefox behave very differently.
 In Safari (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cuzillion-Safari"

\end_inset

), the loading of the first image seems to be deferred until the inline
 script has been executed (the images are displayed when the light purple
 bars become dark purple).
 In Firefox (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cuzillion-Firefox"

\end_inset

), the first image is immediately rendered and after a delay of 2 seconds
 – indeed the execution time of the inline script – the second image is
 rendered (the images are displayed when the gray bars stop).
 Without going into details about this, it should be clear that Cuzillion
 is a simple, yet powerful tool to learn about browser behavior, which can
 in turn help to improve the page loading performance.

\begin_layout Standard
YSlow 1.0 can only evaluate these thirteen rules and has a hardcoded grading
 algorithm.
 You should also remember that YSlow just checks how well a web page implements
 these rules.
 It analyzes the content of your web page (and the headers that were sent
 with it).
 For example, it does not test the latency or speed of a CDN, it just checks
 if you are using one.
 As an example, because you have to tell YSlow (via Firefox' 
\family typewriter
about:config
\family default
) what the domain name of your CDN is, you can even fool YSlow into thinking
 any site is using a CDN: see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That, and the fact that some of the rules it analyzes are only relevant
 to 
\emph on
very
\emph default
 big web sites.
 For example, one of the rules (#13, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 aims to be more extensible and customizable: it will allow for community
 contributions, or even web site specific rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since only YSlow 1.0 is available at the time of writing, I will stick with
 that.
 It is a very powerful and helpful tool as it stands, it will just get better.
 But remember the two caveats: it only verifies rules (it does not measure
 real-world performance) and some of the rules may not be relevant for your
 web site.

 extension that should be used

 It measures how long a page takes to load and it can load a page multiple
 times, to calculate the average and mean page load times.
 Of course, this is a lot less precise than real-world profiling, but it
 allows you to profile while you are working.
 It is far more effective to prevent page loading performance problems due
 to changes in code, because you have the test results within seconds or
 minutes after you have made these changes!

\emph on
hammer

the server, this is where the name comes from).
 And you would still have to set up the separate testing conditions for
 each page load that Hammerhead already sets up for you: empty cache, primed
 cache and for the latter there are again two possible situations: disk
 cache 
\emph on
and
\emph default
 memory cache or just disk cache.
 Memory cache is of course faster than disk cache; that is also why that
 distinction is important.
 Finally, it supports exporting the resulting data into CSV format, so you
 could even create some tools to roughly track page loading performance
 throughout time.

 is an application 
\emph on
designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance
\emph default
.
 In the perspective of profiling page loading performance, the relevant
 features are: loading of web pages with and without its components and
 measuring the response time of just the HTML or the HTML and all the components
 it references.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it has several severe limitations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because it only measures from one location – the location from where it
 is run, it does not give a good big picture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is not an actual browser, so it does not download components referenced
 from CSS or JS files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also because it is not an actual browser, it does not behave the same as
 browsers when it comes to parallel downloads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It requires more setup than Hammerhead (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Hammerhead"

\end_inset

), so it is less likely that a developer will make JMeter part of his workflow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be very useful in case you are doing performance testing (How long
 does the back-end need to generate certain pages?), load testing (how many
 concurrent users can the back-end/server setup handle?) and stress testing
 (how many concurrent users can it handle until errors ensue?).

Limited number of measurement points
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These services poll your site at regular or irregular intervals.
 This poses analysis problems: for example, if one of your servers is very
 slow just at that one moment that any of these services requests a page,
 you will be told that there is a major issue with your site.
 But that is not necessarily true: it might be a fluke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
No real-world browsers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most, if not all of these services use their own custom clients 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 That implies their results are not a representation of the real-world situation
, which means you cannot rely upon these metrics for making decisions: what
 if a commonly used real-world browser behaves completely differently? Even
 if the services would all use real-world browsers, they would never reflect
 real-world performance, because each site has different visitors and therefor
 also a different mix of browsers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unsuited for Web 2.0
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with these services is that they still assume the World Wide
 Web is the same as it was 10 years ago, where JavaScript was rather a scarcity
 than the abundance it is today.
 They still interpret the

 event as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

end time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for response time measurements.
 In Web 1.0, that was fine.
 But as the adoption of AJAX 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AJAX wikipedia"

\end_inset

 has grown, the 
\family typewriter
onload
\family default
 event has become less and less representative of when the page is ready
 (i.e.
 has completely loaded), because the page can continue to load additional
 components.
 For some web sites, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

above the fold
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 section of a web page has been optimized, thereby loading 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 content later, below the fold.
 Thus the

 There are two differences:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Episodes' goal is to become an industry standard.
 This would imply that the aforementioned third party services (Gomez/Keynote/We
bMetrics/Pingdom) would take advantage of the the instrumentations implemented
 through Episodes in their analyses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Most of the implementation is built into browsers (
\family typewriter
window.postMessage(),
\family default
 
\family typewriter
addEventListener()
\family default
), which means there is less code that must be downloaded.
 (Note: the newest versions of browsers are necessary: Internet Explorer
 8, Firefox 3, WebKit Nightlies and Opera 9.5.
 An additional backwards compatibility JavaScript file must be downloaded
 for older browsers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Steve Souders outlines the goals and vision for Episodes succinctly in these
 two paragraphs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\emph on
The goal is to make Episodes the industrywide solution for measuring web
 page load times.

\emph default
 This is possible because Episodes has benefits for all the stakeholders.
 Web developers only need to learn and deploy a single framework.
 Tool developers and web metrics service providers get more accurate timing
 information by relying on instrumentation inserted by the developer of
 the web page.
 Browser developers gain insight into what is happening in the web page
 by relying on the context relayed by Episodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Most importantly, users benefit by the adoption of Episodes.
 They get a browser that can better inform them of the web page's status
 for Web 2.0 apps.
 Since Episodes is a lighter weight design than other instrumentation frameworks
, users get faster pages.
 As Episodes makes it easier for web developers to shine a light on performance
 issues, 
\emph on
the end result is an Internet experience that is faster for everyone
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of things can be said about the current codebase of Episodes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are two JavaScript files: 
\family typewriter
episodes.js
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
episodes-compat.js
\family default
.
 The latter is loaded on-the-fly when an older browser is being used that
 does not support 
\family typewriter
window.postMessage()
\family default
.
 These files are operational but have not had wide testing yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It uses the same query string syntax as Jiffy uses to perform logging, which
 means Jiffy's Apache configuration, ingestor and reporting toolset can
 be reused, at least partially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has its own Firebug extension, see figure

 is to achieve a consensus on a JavaScript-based page loading instrumentation

 to page loading performance (which suggests we might see integration with

\begin_layout Standard
However, for the scope of this thesis, there is one tool that jumps out:
 YSlow.
 It allows you to carefully analyze which things Drupal could be doing better.
 It is not necessarily meaningful in real-world situations, because it e.g.
 only checks if you are using a CDN, not how fast that CDN is.
 But the fact that it tests whether a CDN is being used (or Expired headers,
 or gzipped components, or …) is enough to find out what can be improved,
 to maximize the potential performance.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This kind of analysis is exactly what I will perform in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is one more tool that jumps out for real, practical use: Episodes.
 This tool, if properly integrated with Drupal, would be a key asset to
 Drupal, because it would enable web site owners to track the real-world
 page loading performance.
 It would allow module developers to support Episodes.
 This, in turn, would be a good indicator for a module's quality and would
 allow the web site owner/administrator/developer to carefully analyze each
 aspect of his Drupal web site.

 The things Drupal did wrong then — and still does wrong today because nothing

Static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) should be served with proper HTTP
 headers so that the browser can cache them and reduce the number of HTTP
 requests for each page load.
 Especially the Expires header is important here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To allow for CDN integration in Drupal, the ability to dynamically alter
 file URLs is needed, but this is not supported yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CSS and JS files should be served GZIPped when the browser supports it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JavaScript files should be at the bottom (just before the closing 
\family typewriter

\family default
 tag) whenever possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JavaScript files should be minified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drupal should provide a mechanism to render the same content in multiple
 formats: (X)HTML (for the regular browser), partial HTML or JSON (for AHAH),
 XML (for AJAX) and so on.
 You should be able to set transformations, including cacheability and GZIPabili
ty per format.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I actually wrote two Drupal modules: the Episodes module and the Episodes
 Server module.
 The former is the 
\emph on
actual
\emph default
 integration and can be used without the latter.
 The latter can be installed on a separate Drupal web site or on the same.
 It provides basic reports.
 It is recommended to install this on a separate Drupal web site, and preferably
 even a separate web server, because it has to process a lot of data and
 is not optimized.
 That would have led me too far outside of the scope of this bachelor thesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You could also choose to not enable the Episodes Server module and use an
 external web service to generate reports, but for now, no such services
 yet exist.
 This void will probably be filled in the next few years by the business
 world.
 It might become the subject of my master thesis.

The goal is to measure the different episodes of loading a web page.

The main measurement points are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
starttime: time of requesting the web page (when the 
\family typewriter
onbeforeunload
\family default
 event fires, the time is stored in a cookie); not in the HTML file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
firstbyte: time of arrival of the first byte of the HTML file (the JavaScript
 to measure this time should be as early in the HTML as possible for highest
 possible accuracy); line 1 of the HTML file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
domready: when the entire HTML document is loaded, but 
\emph on
just
\emph default
 the HTML, 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the referenced files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
pageready: when the 
\family typewriter
onload
\family default
 event fires, this happens when also all referenced files are loaded
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
totaltime: when everything, including lazily-loaded content, is loaded (i.e.
 pageready + the time to lazy-load content)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which make for these basic episodes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
backend episode = firstbyte - starttime
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
frontend episode = pageready - firstbyte
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
domready episode = domready - firstbyte, this episode is contained within
 the frontend episode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
totaltime episode = totaltime - starttime, this episode contains the backend
 and frontend episodes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are just the basic time measurements and episodes.
 It is possible to also measure the time it took to load the CSS (lines
 8-9, this would be the 
\family typewriter
css
\family default
 episode) and JavaScript files in the header (line 10, this would be the
 
\family typewriter
headerjs
\family default
 episode) and in the footer (line 27, this would be the 
\family typewriter
footerjs
\family default
 episode), for example.
 It is possible to measure just about anything you want.

The

 file provided at the Episodes example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is in fact just a rough sample implementation, an implementation that indicates
 what it should look like.
 It contained several hardcoded URLs, does not measure the sensible default
 episodes, contains a few bugs.
 In short, it is an excellent and solid start, but it needs some work to
 be truly reusable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There also seems to be a bug in Episodes when used in Internet Explorer
 8.
 It is actually a bug in Internet Explorer 8: near the end of the page loading
 sequence, Internet Explorer 8 seems to be randomly disabling the window.postMess
age() JavaScript function, thereby causing JavaScript errors.
 After a while of searching cluelessly for the cause, I gave up and made
 Internet Explorer 8 also use the backwards-compatibility script (
\family typewriter
episodes-compat.js
\family default
), which overrides the 
\family typewriter
window.postMessage()
\family default
 method.
 The problem had vanished.
 This is not ideal, but at least it works reliably now.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Finally, there also was a bug in the referrer matching logic, or more specifical
ly, it only worked reliably in Internet Explorer and intermittently worked
 in Firefox, due to the differences between browsers in cookie handling.
 Because of this bug, many 
\family typewriter
backend
\family default
 episodes were not being measured, and now they are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I improved 
\family typewriter
episodes.js
\family default
 to make it reusable, so that I could integrate it with Drupal without adding
 Drupal-specific code to it.
 I made it so that all you have to do is something like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\scriptsize},float=h,language=HTML,numbers=left,numberstyle={\scriptsize},tabsize=4"

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	EPISODES.frontendStartTime = Number(new Date());
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	EPISODES.compatScriptUrl = "lib/episodes-compat.js";
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	EPISODES.logging = true;
\end_layout

This way, you can initialize the variables to the desired values without
 customizing

 Line 6 should be as early in the page as possible, because it is the most
 important reference time stamp.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a brief overview with the highlights of what had to be done to integrate
 the Episodes framework with Drupal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implemented 
\family typewriter
hook_install()
\family default
, through which I set a module weight of -1000.
 This extremely low module weight ensures the hook implementations of this
 module are always executed before all others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implemented 
\family typewriter
hook_init()
\family default
, which is invoked at the end of the Drupal bootstrap process.
 Through this hook I automatically insert the JavaScript into the 
\family typewriter
<head>
\family default
 tag that is necessary to make Episodes work (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Episodes.module:reusable"

\end_inset

).
 Thanks to the extremely low module weight, the JavaScript code it inserts
 is the first tag in the 
\family typewriter
<head>
\family default
 tag.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also through this same hook I add 
\family typewriter
Drupal.episodes.js
\family default
, which provides the actual integration with Drupal.
 It automatically creates an episode for each Drupal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

behavior
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 (A behavior is written in JavaScript and adds interactivity to the web
 page.) Each time new content is added to the page through AHAH, 
\family typewriter
Drupal.attachBehaviors()
\family default
 is called and automatically attaches behaviors to new content, but not
 to existing content.
 Through 
\family typewriter
Drupal.episodes.js
\family default
, Drupal's default 
\family typewriter
Drupal.attachBehaviors()
\family default
 method is overridden – this is very easy in JavaScript.
 In this overridden version, each behavior is automatically measured as
 an episode.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thanks to Drupal's existing abstraction and the override I have implemented,
 all JavaScript code can be measured through Episodes without hacking Drupal
 core.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A simplified version of what it does can be seen here:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some of the Drupal behaviors are too meaningless to measure, so it would
 be nice to be able to mark some of the behaviors as ignored.
 That is also something I implemented.
 Basically I do this by locating every directory in which one or more 
\family typewriter
*.js
\family default
 files exist, create a scan job for each of these and queue them in Drupal's
 Batch API 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal Batch API"

\end_inset

.
 Each of these jobs scans each 
\family typewriter
*.js
\family default
 file, looking for behaviors.
 Every detected behavior is stored in the database and can be marked as
 ignored through a simple UI that uses the Hierarchical Select module 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drupal Hierarchial Select"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For measuring the 
\family typewriter
css
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
headerjs
\family default
 episodes, it is necessary to make a couple of simple (copy-and-paste) changes
 to the 
\family typewriter
page.tpl.php
\family default
 of the Drupal theme(s) you are using.
 These changes are explained in the 
\family typewriter
README.txt
\family default
 file that ships with the Episodes module.
 This is the only manual change to code that 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be done – it is recommended, but not required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And of course a configuration UI (see figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Episodes-module-settings-form"

\end_inset

 and figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Episodes-module-behaviors-settings-form"

\end_inset

) using the Forms API 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 It ensures the logging URL (this is the URL through which the collected
 data is logged to Apache's log files) exists and is properly configured
 (i.e.
 returns a zero-byte file).

First of all, the Apache HTTP server is a requirement as this application's
 logging component is used for generating the log files.
 Its logging component has been proven to be scalable, so there is no need
 to roll our own.
\begin_inset Newline newline

The source of this idea lies with Jiffy (see section

\begin_layout Itemize
The ingestor parses the Apache log file and moves the data to the database.
 I was able to borrow a couple of regular expressions from Jiffy's ingestor
 (which is written in Perl) but I completely rewrote it to obtain clean
 and simple code, conform the Drupal coding guidelines.
 It detects the browser, browser version and operating system from the User

Due to lack of time, the basic reports are … well … very basic.
 It would be nice to have more charts and to be able to filter the data
 of the charts.
 In particular, these three filters would be very useful:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
filter by timespan: all time, 1 year, 6 months, 1 month, 1 week, 1 day

Generating the back-end start time on the server can never work reliably
 because the clocks of the client (browser) and server are never perfectly
 in sync, which is required.
 Thus, I simply kept Steve Souders' 
\family typewriter
onbeforeunload
\family default
 method to log the time when a next page was requested.
 The major disadvantage of this method is that it is impossible to measure
 the 
\family typewriter
backend
\family default
 episode for each page load: it is only possible to measure the 
\family typewriter
backend
\family default
 episode when the user navigates through our site (more specifically, when
 the referrer is the same as the current domain).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Even just measuring the page execution time on the server cannot work because
 of this same reason.
 You 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 accurately measure this time, but you cannot 
\emph on
relate
\emph default
 it to the measurements in the browser.
 I implemented this using Drupal's 
\family typewriter
hook_boot()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
hook_exit()
\family default
 hooks and came to this conclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the first page load, the 
\family typewriter
onbeforeunload
\family default
 cookie is not yet set and therefor the 
\family typewriter
backend
\family default
 episode cannot be calculated, which in turn prevents the 
\family typewriter
pageready
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
totalti
\family default
me episodes from being calculated.
 This is of course also a problem when cookies are disabled, because then
 the 
\family typewriter
backend
\family default
 episode can 
\emph on
never
\emph default
 be calculated.
 There is no way around this until the day that browsers provide something
 like 
\family typewriter
document.requestTime
\family default
.

 The real solution is to use a different server to run the Episodes Server
 module on or even an external web service.
 Better even is to log to your own server and then send the logs to an external
 web service.
 This way you stay in control of all your data! Because you still have your
 log data, you can switch to another external web service, thereby avoiding
 vendor lock-in.
 The main reason I opted for using the same database, is ease of development.

Optimizing the profiling tool is not the goal of this bachelor thesis, optimizin

 As I already mentioned before, writing an advanced profiling tool could
 be a master thesis on its own.

Feedback from Steve Souders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I explained Steve Souders what I wanted to achieve through this bachelor
 thesis and the initial work I had already done on integrating Episodes
 with Drupal.
 This is how his reply started:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Wow.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Wow, this is awesome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, at least he thinks that this was a worthwhile job, which suggests that
 it will probably be worthwhile/helpful for the Drupal community as well.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Unfortunately for me, Steve Souders is a very busy man, speaking at many
 web-related conferences, teaching at Stanford, writing books and working
 at Google.
 He did not manage to get back to the questions I asked him.

Daemon

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So now that we have the tools to accurately (or at least 
\emph on
representatively
\emph default
) measure the effects of using a CDN, we still have to start using a CDN.
 Next, we will examine how a web site can take advantage of a CDN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained in section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Key-Properties-CDN"

\end_inset

, there are two very different methods for populating CDNs.
 Supporting pull is easy, supporting push is a lot of work.
 But if we want to avoid vendor lock-in, it is necessary to be able to transpare
ntly switch between pull and any of the transfer protocols for push.
 Suppose that you are using CDN A, which only supports FTP.
 when you want to switch to a cheaper, yet better CDN B, that would be a
 costly operation, because CDN B only supports a custom protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further reduce costs, it is necessary that we can do the preprocessing
 ourselves (be that video transcoding, image optimization or anything else).
 Also note that many CDNs do not support processing of files — but it can
 reduce the amount of bandwidth consumed significantly, and thereby the
 bill received every month.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is why the meat of this thesis is about a daemon that makes it just
 as easy to use either push or pull CDNs and that gives you full flexibility
 in what kind of preprocessing you would like to perform.
 All you will have to do to integrate your web site with a CDN is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
install the daemon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
tell it what to do by filling out a simple configuration file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
start the daemon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
retrieve the URLs of the synced files from an SQLite database (so you can
 alter the existing URLs to files to the ones for the CDN)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Goals
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:daemon:Goals"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As said before, the ability to use either push or pull CDNs is an absolute
 necessity, as is the ability to process files before they are synced to
 the CDN.
 However, there is more to it than just that, so here is a full list of
 goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Easy to use: the configuration file is the interface and explain itself
 just by its structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Transparency: the transfer protocol(s) supported by the CDN should be irrelevant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mixing CDNs and static ﬁle servers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Processing before sync: image optimization, video transcoding …
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Detect (and sync) new ﬁles instantly: through inotify on Linux, FSEvents
 on Mac OS X and the FindFirstChangeNotification API or ReadDirectoryChanges
 API on Windows (there is also the FileSystemWatcher class for .NET)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Robustness: when the daemon is stopped (or when it crashed), it should know
 where it left off and sync all added, modified and deleted files that it
 was still syncing and that have been added, modified and deleted while
 it was not running
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Scalable: syncing 1,000 or 1,000,000 files – and keeping them synced – should
 work just as well
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unit testing wherever feasible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design for reuse wherever possible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Low resource consumption (except for processors, which may be very demanding
 because of their nature)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No dependencies other than Python (but processors can have additional dependenci
es)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All the logic of the daemon should be contained in a single module, to allow
 for quick refactoring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of these goals need more explaining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transparency goal should speak for itself, but you may not yet have
 realized its impact.
 This is what will avoid high CDN provider switching costs, that is, it
 helps to avoid vendor lock-in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Detecting and syncing files instantly is a must to ensure CDN usage is as
 high as possible.
 If new files would only be detected every 10 minutes, then visitors may
 be downloading files directly from the web server instead of from the CDN.
 This increases the load on the web server unnecessarily and also increases
 the page load time for the visitors.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For example, one visitor has uploaded images as part of the content he created.
 All visitors will be downloading the image from the web server, which is
 suboptimal, considering that they could have been downloading it from the
 CDN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to mix CDNs and static file servers makes it possible to either
 maximize the page loading performance or minimize the costs.
 Depending on your company's customer base, you may either want to pay for
 a global CDN or a local one.
 If you are a global company, a global CDN makes sense.
 But if you are present only in a couple of countries, say the U.S.A., Japan
 and France, it does not make sense to pay for a global CDN.
 It is probably cheaper to pay for a North-American CDN and a couple of
 strategically placed static file servers in Japan and France to cover the
 rest of your customer base.
 Without this daemon, this is rather hard to set up.
 With it however, it becomes child's play: all you have to do, is configure
 multiple destinations.
 That is all there is to it.
 It is then still up to you how you use these files, though.
 To decide from which server you will let your visitors download the files,
 you could look at the IP, or if your visitors must register, at the country
 they have entered in their profile.
 This also allows for event-driven server allocation.
 For example if a big event is being hosted in Paris, you could temporarily
 hire another server in Paris to ensure low latency and high throughput.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Other use cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The daemon, or at least one or more of the modules that were written for
 it, can be reused in other applications.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Back-up tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Video transcoding server (e.g.
 to transcode videos uploaded by visitors to H.264 or Flash video)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Key component in creating your own CDN
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Key component in a file synchronization tool for consumers 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Configuration file design
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:daemon:Configuration-file-design"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the configuration file is the interface and I had a good idea of the
 features I wanted to support, I started by writing a configuration file.
 That might be unorthodox, but in the end, this is the most important part
 of the daemon.
 If it is too hard to configure, nobody will use it.
 If it is easy to use, more people will be inclined to give it a try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judge for yourself how easy it is by looking at listing
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:sample-config-file"

\end_inset

.
 Beneath the config root node, there are 3 child nodes, one for each of
 the 3 major sections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
sources
\family default
: indicate each data source in which new, modified and deleted files will
 be detected recursively.
 Each source has a name (that we will reference later in the configuration
 file) and of course a 
\family typewriter
scanPath
\family default
, which defines the root directory within which new/modified/deleted files
 will be detected.
 It can also optionally have the 
\family typewriter
documentRoot
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
basePath
\family default
 attributes, which may be necessary for some processors that perform magic
 with URLs.
 
\family typewriter
sources
\family default
 itself also has an optional 
\family typewriter
ignoredDirs
\family default
 attribute, which will subsequently be applied to all 
\family typewriter
filter
\family default
 nodes.
 While unnecessary, this prevents needless duplication of 
\family typewriter
ignoredDirs
\family default
 nodes inside 
\family typewriter
filter
\family default
 nodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
servers
\family default
: provide the settings for all servers that will be used in this configuration.
 Each server has a 
\family typewriter
name
\family default
 and a 
\family typewriter
transporter
\family default
 that it should use.
 The child nodes of the 
\family typewriter
server
\family default
 node are the settings that are passed to that transporter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
rules
\family default
: this is the heart of the configuration file, since this is what determines
 what goes where.
 Each rule is associated with a source (via the 
\family typewriter
for
\family default
 attribute), must have a 
\family typewriter
label
\family default
 attribute and can consist (but does not have to!) of three parts:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
filter
\family default
: can contain 
\family typewriter
paths
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
extensions
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ignoredDirs
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
pattern
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
size
\family default
 child nodes.
 The text values of these nodes will be used to filter the files that have
 been created, modified or deleted within the source to which this rule
 applies.
 If it is a match, then the rule will be applied (and therefor the processor
 chain and destination associated with it).
 Otherwise, this rule is ignored for that file.
 See the filter module (section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:daemon:modules:filter.py"

\end_inset

) explanation for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
processorChain
\family default
: accepts any number of 
\family typewriter
processor
\family default
 nodes through which you reference (via the 
\family typewriter
name
\family default
 attribute) the processor module and the specific processor class within
 that processor module that you would like to use.
 They will be chained in the order you specify here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
destinations
\family default
: accepts any number of 
\family typewriter
destination
\family default
 nodes through which you specify all servers to which the file should be
 transported.
 Each 
\family typewriter
destination
\family default
 node must have a 
\family typewriter
server
\family default
 attribute and can have a 
\family typewriter
path
\family default
 attribute.
 The 
\family typewriter
path
\family default
 attribute sets a parent path (on the server) inside which the files will
 be transported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reading the above should make less sense than simply reading the configuration
 file.
 If that is the case for you too, then I succeeded.

This module provides the 
\family typewriter
Filter
\family default
 class.
 Through this class, you can check if a given file path matches a set of
 conditions.
 This class is used to determine which processors should be applied to a
 given file and to which CDN it should be synced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class has just 2 methods: 
\family typewriter
set_conditions()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
matches()
\family default
.
 There are 5 different conditions you can set.
 The last two should be used with care, because they are a lot slower than
 the first three.
 Especially the last one can be very slow, because it must access the file
 system.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If there are several valid options within a single condition, a match with
 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 of them is sufficient (OR).
 Finally, 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 conditions must be satisfied (AND) before a given file path will result
 in a positive match.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The five conditions that can be set (as soon as one or more conditions are
 set, 
\family typewriter
Filter
\family default
 will work) are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
paths
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
ignoredDirs
\family default
: a list of directories (separated by colons) that should be ignored, meaning

As is to be expected, this module provides the 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
 class, which scans paths and stores them in a SQLite 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 database.
 You can use 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
 to detect changes in a directory structure.
 For efficiency, only creations, deletions and modifications are detected,
 not moves.
 This class is used to scan the file system for changes when no supported
 filesystem monitor is installed on the current operating system.
 It is also used for persistent storage: when the daemon has been stopped,
 the database built and maintained through/by this class is used as a reference,
 to detect changes that have happened before it was started again.
 This mean 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
 is used during the initialization of the daemon, regardless of the available
 file system monitors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The database schema is very simple: (
\family typewriter
path
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
filename
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
mtime
\family default
).
 Directories are also stored; in that case, 
\family typewriter
path
\family default
 is the path of the parent directory, 
\family typewriter
filename
\family default
 is the directory name and 
\family typewriter
mtime
\family default
 is set to -1.
 Modified files are detected by comparing the current mtime with the value
 stored in the 
\family typewriter
mtime
\family default
 column.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changes to the database are committed in batches, because changes in the
 filesystem typically occur in batches as well.
 Changes are committed to the database on a per-directory level.
 However, if many changes occurred in a single directory and if every change
 would be committed separately, the concurrency level would rise unnecessarily.
 By default, every batch of 50 changes inside a directory is committed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class provides you with 8 methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
initial_scan()
\family default
 to build the initial database – works recursively
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
scan()
\family default
 to get the changes – does not work recursively
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
scan_tree()
\family default
 (uses 
\family typewriter
scan()
\family default
) to get the changes in an entire directory structure – obviously works
 recursively
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
purge_path()
\family default
 to purge all the metadata for a path from the database
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
add_files(),
\family default
 
\family typewriter
update_files()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
remove_files()
\family default
 to add/update/remove files manually (useful when your application has more/fast
er knowledge of changes)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Special care had to be taken to not scan directory trees below directories
 that are in fact symbolic links.
 This design decision was made to mimic the behavior of file system monitors,
 which are incapable of following symbolic links.
\end_layout

\family typewriter
fsmonitor_inotify.py
\family default

\begin_layout Standard
Windows support is possible, but has not been implemented yet due to time
 constraints.
 There are two APIs to choose between: FindFirstChangeNotification and ReadDirec
toryChanges.
 There is a third, the FileSystemWatcher class, but this is only usable
 from within .NET and Visual C++, so it is an unlikely option because it
 is not directly accessible from within Python.
 This was already mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:daemon:Goals"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ReadDirectoryChanges API is more similar to inotify in that it triggers
 events on the file level.
 The disadvantage is that this is a blocking API.
 FindFirstChangeNotification is a non-blocking API, but is more similar
 to FSEvents, in that it triggers events on the directory level.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Implementation obstacles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make this class work consistently, less critical features that are only
 available for specific file system monitors are abstracted away.
 And other features are emulated.
 It comes down to the fact that 
\family typewriter
FSMonitor
\family default
's API is very simple to use and only supports 5 different events: 
\family typewriter
CREATED
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
MODIFIED
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
DELETED
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
MONITORED_DIR_MOVED
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
DROPPED_EVENTS
\family default
.
 The last 2 events are only triggered for inotify and FSEvents.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A persistent mode is also supported, in which all metadata is stored in
 a database.
 This allows you to even track changes when your program was not running.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, only 3 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 events of interest are supported: the most common ones.
 This is because not every API supports all features of the other APIs.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

inotify is the most complete in this regard: it supports a boatload of different
 events, on a file-level.
 But it only provides realtime events: it does not maintain a complete history
 of events.
 And that is understandable: it is impossible to maintain a history of 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 file system event.
 Over time, there would not be any space left to store actual data.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

FSEvents on the other hand, works on the directory-level, so you have to
 maintain your own directory tree state to detect created, modified and
 deleted files.
 It only triggers a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a change has occurred in this directory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 event.
 This is why for example there is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

file moved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 event: it would be too resource-intensive to detect, or at the very least
 it would not scale.
 On the plus side, FSEvents maintains a complete history of events.
 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
scan()
\family default
 method is used to detect the changes to the files in each directory that
 was changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementations that do not support file-level events (FSEvents and polling)
 are persistent by design.
 Because the directory tree state must be maintained to be able to trigger
 the correct events, 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:daemon:modules:pathscanner.py"

\end_inset

) is used for storage.
 They use 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
(add|update|remove)_files()
\family default
 functions to keep the database up-to-date.
 And because the entire directory tree state is always stored, you can compare
 the current directory tree state with the stored one to detect changes,
 either as they occur (by being notified of changes on the directory level)
 or as they have occurred (by scanning the directory tree manually).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the persistent mode, we could take advantage of 
\family typewriter
FSEvents
\family default
' ability to look back in time.
 However, again due to time constraints, the same approach is used for every
 implementation: a manual scanning procedure – using 
\family typewriter
PathScanner
\family default
 – is started after the file system monitor starts listening for new events
 on a given path.
 That way, no new events are missed.
 This works equally well as using FSEvents' special support for this; it
 is just slower.
 But it is sufficient for now.
 This was not implemented due to time constraints.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To implement this, one would simply need to get the highest 
\family typewriter
mtime
\family default
 (modification time of a file) stored in the database, and then ask 
\family typewriter
FSEvents
\family default
 to send the events from that starting time to our callback function, instead
 of starting from the current time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
persistent_queue.py and persistent_list.py
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to provide data persistency , I wrote a 
\family typewriter
PersistentQueue
\family default
 class and a 
\family typewriter
PersistentList
\family default
 class.
 As their names indicate, these provide you with a persistent queue and
 a persistent list.
 They use again an SQLite database for persistent storage.
 For each instance you create, you must choose the table name and you can
 optionally choose which database file to write to.
 This allows you to group persistent data structures in a logical manner
 (i.e.
 related persistent data structures can be stored in the same database file,
 thereby also making it portable and easy to backup).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prevent excessive file system access due to an overreliance on SQLite,
 I also added in-memory caching.
 To ensure low resource consumption, only the first X items in 
\family typewriter
PersistentQueue
\family default
 are cached in-memory (a minimum and maximum threshold can be configured),
 but for 
\family typewriter
PersistentList
\family default
 there is no such restriction: it is cached in-memory in its entirety.
 It is not designed for large datasets, but 
\family typewriter
PersistentQeueue
\family default
 is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
PersistentQueue
\family default
 is used to store the events that have been triggered by changes in the
 file system via 
\family typewriter
fsmonitory.py
\family default
: 
\family typewriter
(input_file, event)
\family default
 pairs are stored in a persistent queue.
 Because the backlog (especially the one after the initial scan) can become
 very large (imagine 1 million files needing to be synced), this was a necessity.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
PersistentList
\family default
 is used to store the files that are currently being processed and the list
 of files that have failed to sync.
 These must also be stored persistently, because if the daemon is interrupted
 while still syncing files, these lists will not be empty, and data could
 be lost.
 Because they are persistent, the daemon can add the files in these lists
 to the queue of files to be synced again, and the files will be synced,
 as if the daemon was never interrupted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first question to arise is: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why use SQLite in favor of Python's built-in 
\family typewriter
shelve
\family default
 module 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Python shelve"

\end_inset

?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Well, the answer is simple: aside from the benefit of the ability to have
 all persistent data in a single file, it must also scale to tens of thousands
 or even millions of files.
 
\family typewriter
shelve
\family default
 is not scalable because its data is loaded into memory in its entirety.
 This could easily result in hundreds of megabytes of memory usage.
 Such excessive memory usage should be avoided at all costs when the target
 environment is a (web) server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your next question would probably be: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

How can you be sure the SQLite database will not get corrupt?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The answer is: we can not.
 But the same applies to Python's 
\family typewriter
shelve
\family default
 module.
 However, the aforementioned advantages of SQLite give plenty of reasons
 to choose SQLite over 
\family typewriter
shelve
\family default
.
 Plus, SQLite is thoroughly tested, even against corruption 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SQLite testing"

\end_inset

.
 It is also used for very large datasets (it works well for multi-gigabyte
 databases but is not designed for terabyte-scale databases 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SQLite when to use"

\end_inset

) and by countless companies, amongst which Adobe, Apple, Google, Microsoft
 and Sun 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SQLite well-known users"

\end_inset

.
 So it is the best bet you can make.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, you would probably ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Why not use MySQL or PostgreSQL or …?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Again the answer is brief: because SQLite requires no additional setup
 since it is 
\emph on
serverless
\emph default
, as opposed to MySQL and PostgreSQL.

This module provides several classes: 
\family typewriter
Processor
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChainFactory
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Processor
\family default
 is a base class for processors, which are designed to be easy to write
 yourself.
 Processors receive an input file, do something with it and return the output
 file.
 The 
\family typewriter
Processor
\family default
 class takes a lot of the small annoying tasks on its shoulders, such as
 checking if the file is actually a file this processor can process, calculating
 the default output file, checking if the processor (and therefor the entire
 chain of processors) should be run per server or not and a simple abstraction
 around an otherwise multi-line construction to run a command.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Upon completion, a callback will be called.
 Another callback is called in case of an error.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

An example can found in listing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lst:Processors-YUICompressor"

\end_inset

.
 For details, please consult the daemon's documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Processors are allowed to make any change they want to the file's contents
 and are executed before a file is synced, most often to reduce the size
 of the file and thereby to decrease the page loading time.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

They are also allowed to change the base name of the input file, but they
 are not allowed to change its path.
 This measure was taken to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored
 to know which file is stored where exactly in the database of synced files
 (see later: section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Putting-it-all"

\end_inset

).
 This is enforced 
\emph on
by convention
\emph default
, because in Python it is impossible to truly enforce anything.
 If you do change the path, the file will sync just fine, but it will be
 impossible to delete the old version of a modified file, unless it results
 in the exact same path and base name each time it runs through the processor
 chain.

 PNG8 offers lossless image quality, as does GIF, but results in a smaller

 PNG8 is also supported in all browsers, including IE6.
 The alpha channels of true color PNG (PNG24 & PNG32) are not supported
 in IE6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PNG files are stored in so-called

 I decided not to use the brute force method, which tries over a hundred
 different methods for optimization, but just the 10 most common ones.
 The brute force method would result in 30 seconds of processing versus
 less than a second otherwise.

\begin_layout Standard
JPEG files can be optimized in three complementary ways: stripping metadata,
 optimizing the Huffman tables and making them progressive.
 There are two variations to store a JPEG file: baseline and progressive.
 A baseline JPEG file is stored as one top-to-bottom scan, whereas a progressive
 JPEG file is stored as a series of scans, with each scan gradually improving
 the quality of the overall image.
 Stoyan Stefanov's tests 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "imageopt-4"

\end_inset

 have pointed out that there is a 75% chance that the JPEG file is best
 saved as baseline when it is smaller than 10 KB.
 For JPEG files larger than 10 KB, it is 94% likely that progressive JPEG
 will result in a better compression ratio.
 That is why the third optimization (making JPEG files progressive) is only
 applied when the file is larger than 10 KB.
 All these optimizations are applied using jpegtran

 to achieve that.

\begin_layout Standard
There is one important nuance though: stripping metadata may also remove
 the copyright information, which may have legal consequences.
 So it is not recommended to strip metadata when some of the photos being
 hosted have been bought, which may be the situation for a newspaper web
 site, for example.

All it does is resolving relative URLs (relative to the CSS file or relative
 to the document root) to absolute paths on the file system, then looking
 up the corresponding URLs on the CDN and placing those instead in the CSS
 file.
 If one of the referenced files cannot be found on the file system, this
 URL remains unchanged.

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
 and clean, pragmatic design.
 It is growing very strong in popularity.
 It is very different from Drupal, which aims to be both a CMS (install
 it and you have a working web site) and a framework.
 Django just aims to be a framework.
 It has APIs for many things, ranging from caching, database abstraction,
 forms to sessions, syndication, authentication and of course storage systems.
 I have extract that single API (and its dependencies) from Django and am
 reusing it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Since Django is a well-known, widely used open source project with many

Because the daemon relies on (unmodified!) Django code, it can benefit from
 bugfixes/features applied to Django's code and can use custom storage systems

 custom storage systems.

For the last two, transporters are available.
 The first three are not so widely used and thus not yet implemented, although
 it would be very easy to support them, exactly because all that is necessary,
 is to write thin wrappers.
 For the third, a transporter was planned, but scrapped due to time constraints.
 The fourth is not very meaningful to use, since the fifth is better (better
 maintained and higher performance).

The 
\family typewriter
CloudFilesStorage
\family default
 custom storage class is part of 
\family typewriter
django-storages
\family default
 thanks to my mediations.
 An early tester of the daemon requested 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 support for Cloud Files and interestingly enough, one day before, somebody
 had published a Python package (
\family typewriter
django-cumulus
\family default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "django-cumulus"

\end_inset

) that did just that.
 Within a week, a dependency on django-storages was added from 
\family typewriter
django-cumulus
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
django-storages
\family default
 had Cloud Files support.
 This is further confirmation that I had made a good choice: it suggests
 that my choice for 
\family typewriter
django-storages
\family default
 is beneficial for both projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I clearly managed to make a big shortcut (although it had to be made
 working outside of Django itself) to achieve my goal: supporting CDNs that
 rely on FTP or origin pulling (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Key-Properties-CDN"

\end_inset

), as well as the Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront CDNs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, supporting origin pull was trickier than would seem at first.
 Normally, you just rewrite your URLs and be done with it.
 However, I wanted to support processing files prior to syncing them to
 the CDN.
 And I want to keep following the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do not touch the original file
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rule.
 With push, that is no problem, you just process the file, store the output
 file in a temporary directory, push the file and delete it afterwards.
 But what about pull?
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I had to be creative here.
 Since files must remain available for origin pull (in case the CDN wants/needs
 to update its copy), all files must be copied to another publicly accessible
 path in the web site.
 But what about files that are not modified? Or have just changed filenames
 (for unique URLs)? Copying these means storing the exact same data twice.
 The answer is fortunately very simple: symbolic links.
 Although available only on UNIX, it is very much worth it: it reduces redundant
 data storage significantly.
 This was then implemented in a new custom storage system: 
\family typewriter
SymlinkOrCopyStorage
\family default
, which copies modified files and symlinks unmodified ones.

In total, I have contributed three patches to

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
It enables the saving of large files by no longer reading all the chunks
 of the file in a single string.
 Instead it uses 
\family typewriter
ftplib.storbinary()
\family default
 directly with a file pointer, which then handles the writing in chunks
 automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It makes 
\family typewriter
exists()
\family default
 more reliable: it has been tested with two different FTP servers and so
 far it works without problems with the following FTP servers, whereas it
 did not work with any of them before:

The 
\family typewriter
Content-Type
\family default
 header is set automatically via guessing based on the extension.
 This is done through mimetypes.guesstype.
 Right now, no Content-Type is set, and therefor the default binary mimetype
 is set: application/octet- stream.
 This causes browsers to download files instead of displaying them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The ACL (i.e.
 file permissions) now actually gets applied properly to the bucket and
 to each file that is saved to the bucket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Currently, URLs are generated with query-based authentication (which implies
 ridiculously long URLs will be generated) and HTTPS is used instead of
 HTTP, thereby preventing browsers from caching files.
 I have disabled query authentication and HTTPS, as this is the most common
 use case for serving files.
 This probably should be configurable, but that can be done in a revised
 patch or a follow-up patch.

Now that you have an insight in the big picture, let us examine how exactly

 controls all components, and what happens before the

\family default
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, an 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator
\family default
 object is created and its constructor does the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
create a logger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
parse the configuration file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
verify the existence of all processors and transporters that are referenced
 from the configuration file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
connect to each server (as defined in the configuration file) to ensure
 it is working
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, the 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator
\family default
 object is passed to a 
\family typewriter
DaemonThreadRunner
\family default
 object, which then runs the arbitrator in such a way that it can be stopped
 through signals.
 The arbitrator is then started.
 The following happens:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
setup
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
create transporter pools (analogous to worker thread pools) for each server.
 These pools remain empty until transporters are necessary, because transporters
 are created whenever they are deemed necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
collect all metadata for each rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
initialize all data structures for the pipeline (queues, persistent queues
 and persistent lists)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
move files from the 'files in pipeline' persistent list to the 'pipeline'
 persistent queue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
move files from the 'failed files' persistent list to the 'pipeline' persistent
 queue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
create a database connection to the 'synced files' database
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
initialize the file system monitor (

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
stop the file system monitor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
process the discover queue once more to sync the final batch of files to
 the persistent pipeline queue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
stop all transporters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
log some statistics
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
That is 
\emph on
roughly
\emph default
 the logic of the daemon.
 It should already make some sense, but it is likely that it is not yet
 clear what all the queues are for.
 And how they are being filled and emptied.
 So now it is time to learn about the daemon's

Pipeline design pattern

, is slightly under documented, but it is still a very useful design pattern.
 Its premise is to deliver an architecture to divide a large processing
 task into smaller, sequential steps (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Filters
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 are finally connected via Pipes.

\begin_layout Standard
In my case, files are discovered and are then put into the pipeline queue.
 When they actually move into the pipeline (at which point they are added
 to the 'files in pipeline' persistent list), they start by going into the
 filter queue, after being filtered they go into the process queue (possibly
 more than once), after being processed to the transport queue (again possibly
 more than once), after being transported to the db queue, after being stored
 in the database, they are removed from the 'files in pipeline' persistent
 list and we are done for this file.
 Repeat for every discovered file.
 This is the 
\emph on
core logic
\emph default
 of the daemon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So many queues are used because there are so many stages in the pipeline.
 There is a queue for each stage in the pipeline, plus some additional ones
 because the persistent data structures use the pysqlite module, which only
 allows you to access the database from the same thread as the connection
 was created in.
 Because I (have to) work with callbacks, the calling thread may be different
 from the creating thread, and therefor there are several queues that exist
 solely for exchanging data between threads.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There is one persistent queue and two persistent lists.
 The persistent queue is the pipeline queue, which contains all files that
 are queued to be sent through the pipeline.
 The first persistent list is 'files in pipeline'.
 It is used to ensure files still get processed if the daemon was killed
 (or crashed) while they were in the pipeline.
 The second persistent list is 'failed files' and contains all files for
 which either a processor in the processor chain or a transporter failed.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When the daemon is restarted, the contents of the 'files in pipeline' and
 'failed files' lists are pushed into the pipeline queue, after which they
 are erased.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Queues are either filled through the 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator

 (because it moves data from one queue to the next):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

process 
\emph on
filter
\emph default
 queue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method (if the rule has no processor chain associated with it).
 To know when a file has been synced to all its destinations, the 'remaining
 transporters' list gets a new key (the concatenation of the input file,
 the event and the string representation of the rule) and the value of that
 key is a list of all servers to which this file will be synced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
db
\emph default
 queue is filled through a 
\family typewriter
Transporter
\family default
's callback.
 Each time this callback fires, it also carries information on which server
 the file has just been transported to.
 This server is then removed from the 'remaining transporters' list for
 this file.
 When no servers are left in this list, the sync is complete and the file
 can be removed from the 'files in pipeline' persistent list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Transporter
\family default
 callbacks only carry information about the file they have just been operating
 on, I had to find an elegant method to transfer the additional metadata
 for this file, which is necessary to let the file continue through the
 pipeline.
 I have found this in the form of currying
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "currying"

\end_inset

.
 Currying is dynamically creating a new function that calls another function,
 but with some arguments already filled out.
 An example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\scriptsize}"
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

curried_callback = curry(self.processor_chain_callback, event=event, rule=rule)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function 
\family typewriter
self.processor_chain_callback
\family default
 accepts the 
\family typewriter
event
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
rule
\family default
 arguments, but the 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 class has no way of accepting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

additional data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 arguments.
 So instead of rewriting 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 (and the exact same thing applies to 
\family typewriter
Transporter
\family default
), I simply create a curried callback, that will automatically fill out
 the arguments that the 
\family typewriter
ProcessorChain
\family default
 callback by itself could never fill out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

process 
\emph on
X
\emph default
 queue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 methods acquires 
\family typewriter
Arbitrator
\family default
's lock before accessing any of the queues.
 
\emph on
Before
\emph default
 a file is removed from the pipeline queue, it is added to the 'files in
 pipeline' persistent list (this is possible thanks to 
\family typewriter
PersistentQueue
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
peek()
\family default
 method), and then it is removed from the pipeline queue.
 This implies that at no time after the file has been added to the pipeline
 queue, it can be lost.
 The worst case scenario is that the daemon crashes between adding the file
 to the 'files in pipeline' persistent list and removing it from the pipeline
 queue.
 Then it will end up twice in the queue.
 But the second sync will just overwrite the first one, so all that is lost,
 is CPU time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

allow retry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 method allows failed files (in the 'failed files' persistent list) to be
 retried, by adding them back to the pipeline queue.
 This happens whenever the pipeline queue is getting empty, or every 30
 seconds.
 This ensures processors that use the 
\family typewriter
RequestToRequeueException
\family default
 exception can retry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only truly weak link is unavoidable: if the daemon crashes somewhere
 between having performed the callback from 
\family typewriter
FSMonitor
\family default
, adding that file to the discover queue and syncing the file from the discover
 queue to the pipeline queue (which is necessary due to the thread locality
 restriction of pysqlite).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Performance tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have performed fairly extensive tests on both Mac OS X and Linux.
 The application behaved identically on both platforms, despite the fact
 that different file system monitors are being used in the background.
 The rest of this cross-platform functioning without problems is thanks
 to Python.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All tests were performed on the local network, i.e.
 with a FTP server running on the localhost.
 Very small scale tests have been performed with the Amazon S3 and CloudFront
 transporters, and since they worked, the results should apply to those
 as well.
 It does not and should not matter which transporter is being used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At all times, the memory usage remained below 17 MB on Mac OS X and below
 7 MB on Linux (unless the update_linker processor module was used, in which
 case it leaks memory like a madman – the 
\family typewriter
cssutils
\family default
 Python module is to blame).
 A backlog of more than 10,000 files was no problem.
 Synchronizing 10 GB of files was no problem.
 I also tried a lot of variations in the configuration and all of them worked
 (well, sometimes it needed some bug fixing of course).
 Further testing should happen in real-world environments.
 Even tests in which I forced processors or transporters to crash were completed
 successfully: no files were lost and they would be synced again after restartin
g the daemon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Possible further optimizations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Files should be moved from the discover queue to the pipeline queue in a
 separate thread, to minimize the risk of losing files due to a crashed
 application before files are moved to the pipeline queue.
 In fact, the discover queue could be eliminated altogether thanks to this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Track progress of transporters and allow them to be be stopped while still
 syncing a file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Make processors more error resistent by allowing them to check the environment,
 so they can ensure third party applications, such as YUI Compressor or
 jpegtran are installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 since they are most likely the cause of problems thanks to the fact that
 users can easily write their own Processors.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be obvious by now that we still need a module to integrate Drupal
 with a CDN, as Drupal does not provide such functionality on its own –
 if it did, then this bachelor thesis would be titled differently.
 This is the end of the long journey towards supporting the simplest and
 the most complex CDN or static file server setups one can make.
 Fortunately, this is all fairly trivial, except for maybe the necessary
 Drupal core patch.
\end_layout

Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The daemon I wrote is not necessary for Origin Pull CDNs.
 So this module should support those through a simple UI.
 On the other hand, it must also be easy to use the daemon for a Drupal
 web site.
 The former is called 
\emph on
basic mode
\emph default
 and the latter is called
\emph on
 advanced mode
\emph default
, thereby indicating that the latter is more complex to set up (i.e.
 it requires you to set up the daemon).

Drupal core patch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had the chance to speak to Andrew 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

drewish
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Morton at DrupalCon DC about the Drupal core patch that is necessary for
 the CDN integration module for Drupal to become possible.
 He is the one who managed to get his proposed Drupal File API patches committed
 to the current development version of Drupal (which will become Drupal
 7).
 So he definitely is the person to go to for all things concerning files
 in Drupal right now.
 I explained to him the need for a unified file URL generation/alteration
 mechanism and he immediately understood and agreed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drupal already has one function to generate file URLs: 
\family typewriter
file_create_url($path)
\family default
.
 Unfortunately, this function is only designed to work for files that have
 been uploaded by users or are generated by modules (e.g.
 transformations of images).
 And now the bad news: there is no function through which the URLs for the
 other files (the ones that are not uploaded but are shipped with Drupal
 core and modules and themes) are generated.
 To be honest, the current method for generating these URLs is very ugly,
 although very simple: prepend the base path to the relative file path.
 So if you want to serve the file 
\family typewriter
misc/jquery.js
\family default
 (which is part of Drupal core), then you would write the following code
 to generate an URL for it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\scriptsize}"
inline true
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$url = base_path() .
 'misc/jquery.js';
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andrew and I agreed that since eventually both kinds of files are typically
 served from the same server(s), it only makes sense to generate their URLs
 through one function.
 So the sensible thing to do was to also route the non-uploaded files through
 the 
\family typewriter
file_create_url()
\family default
 function to generate their URLs.
 And then there would be a function that a module could implement, 
\family typewriter
custom_file_url_rewrite($path)
\family default
 which would then allow file URLs to be altered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, I wrote a Drupal core patch exactly according to these specifications,
 and it works great.
 However, we must fall back to the old mechanisms in case the 
\family typewriter
custom_file_url_rewrite()
\family default
 function returns 
\family typewriter
FALSE
\family default
 (meaning that the CDN cannot or should not serve the file).
 But since there is a distinction between uploaded/generated files and shipping
 files, we must first determine which kind of file it is.
 This can be done by looking at the path that was given to 
\family typewriter
file_create_url()
\family default
: if it begins with the path of the directory that the Drupal administrator
 chose to use for uploaded and generated files, then it is an uploaded/generated
 file.
 After this distinction has been made, the original procedures are applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This patch was also ported to Drupal 7 (which will be the next version of
 Drupal) and submitted for review.
 Unit tests were added (this is a requirement).
 The reviews are very positive so far (with Dries Buytaert, the Drupal founder,
 simply commenting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Awesome.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and adding it to his list of favorite patches) but it was submitted too
 late to ensure it got committed before this thesis text had to be finalized.
 However, the positivity of the reviews suggests that is is very likely
 that the patch will get committed.

.
 Advanced mode cannot be started if the daemon is not configured properly
 yet (by ensuring the synced files database exists).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The per-page statistics are rendered through Drupal's 
\family typewriter
hook_exit()
\family default
, which is called just before the end of each page request.
 It is therefor able to render after the rest of the page is rendered, which
 of course implies that all file URLs have been created, so it is safe to
 calculate the statistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\family typewriter
hook_requirements()
\family default
 implementation was created, which allows me to add information about the
 CDN integration module to Drupal's status report page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The aforementioned 
\family typewriter
custom_file_url_rewrite()
\family default
 function was implemented, which rewrites the URL based on the mode.
 In basic mode, the CDN URL is automatically inserted into file URLs and
 in advanced mode, the synced files database is queried.
 This is an SQLite database, which the Drupal 6 database abstraction layer
 does not support.
 Drupal 7's database abstraction layer does support SQLite, but is still
 in development (and will be for at least 6 more months).
 Fortunately, there is also PDO
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which makes this sufficiently easy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is all there is to tell about this module.
 It is very simple: all complexity is now embedded in the daemon, as it
 should be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparison with the old CDN integration module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In January 2008, I wrote the initial version of the CDN integration module.
 It was written for Drupal 5 instead of Drupal 6 though and was pure PHP
 code, and thus limited by PHP's constraints.
 It did not support Origin Pull CDNs.
 Instead, it only supported push CDNs that were accessible over FTP.
 The synchronization happened from within Drupal, on each cron run.
 Which means it relied on manual file system scanning (i.e.
 polling) to detect changes and was prevented by design to perform concurrent
 syncs, since PHP cannot do that.
 To top it off, it did not store anything in the database, but in a serialized
 array, which had to be unserialized on every page to retrieve the URLs.
 It should be obvious that this was significantly slower and absolutely
 unscalable and definitely unusable on any 
\emph on
real
\emph default
 web sites out there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It had its algorithms right though.
 You could consider it a very faint preview of what the end result looks
 like right now.

Feedback from businesses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I had a nice list of seven companies who wanted to test my bachelor thesis,
 either the CDN integration for Drupal using the CDN or just the daemon
 (for either syncing files to a static file server or to back up servers).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I gave them more than three weeks time to test this, which is a fairly large
 amount of time, considering that the whole timespan of the thesis was about
 4 months.
 Unfortunately, these are actual companies, each with their own schedules
 and clients to keep satisfied.
 So, as was to be expected, the feedback I 
\emph on
actually
\emph default
 got was far more sparse than I hoped for.
 However unfortunate, this is of course understandable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three CDNs promised me to provide me (and the businesses that were going
 to test my work) free CDN accounts for testing purposes.
 Two of them immediately gave me accounts: SimpleCDN

Kay Webber, whom works for SlideME and is responsible for integrating my
 daemon with the infrastructure, made four suggestions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On his servers with the CentOS operating system , only Python 2.4 was available,
 whereas, my daemon requires Python 2.5.
 He made the changes necessary to get it to work in Python 2.4.
 He did not manage to find a pyinotify package for his Linux distribution
 however, making 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor.py
\family default
 fall back to the polling mechanism.
 However, not all of the Python packages I use are guaranteed to work with
 Python 2.4 (because Python 2.4 is quite old already, it was released in November
 2004).
 On most servers, it is possible to install Python 2.5 with a single command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The daemon is run on the editor instance, but the database of synced files
 needs to be accessed from the viewer instances as well.
 Therefor, he is working on a patch to also support storing the synced files
 database in a MySQL database (which supports replication) instead of just
 SQLite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
He would like to be able to use environment variables in the configuration
 file.
 He is also working on a patch for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
He needs the ability to upload

\begin_layout Quote
The configuration file was mostly but not

 self-explanatory.
 For example, I missed the connection between

\family default
 and named them differently at the beginning.
 But I have no suggestions for this case.
\begin_inset Newline newline

Since you have already been writing patches: what did you think of the code
 structure?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Clear and self-explanatory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How would you rate the performance? (Keeping in mind that discovering files
 is orders of magnitude slower due to the fallback to polling for detecting
 changes.) How many files are you syncing and what is their combined size?
\end_layout

I have not started performance tests yet, so I cannot rate it.

Jonathan Lambert, the CEO, was very enthusiastic about the inotify support
 of the daemon and the lossless compression of images (by removing metadata
 and optimizing the way they are stored internally).
 He also liked the idea to be able to pick from within the CDN integration
 module for Drupal which server files would be served to a visitor.
\begin_inset Newline newline

His company has a product which allows customers to use his

 This

virtual CDN

 then uses multiple

actual

 CDNs.
 This implies that files must be synced to multiple servers and that is
 where my daemon could be very useful.
 That is also the use case he is evaluating it for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, overall, the impression seems to be very good.
 The feature set seems to be strongly appreciated.
 The documentation in general, setting it up and the configuration file
 were strongly approved.
 The code structure even more.
 Neither had the time yet to do real-world tests.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The trend in the answers suggests that the code structure is sufficiently
 solid and that it conceptually makes sense; that setup and configuration
 are sufficiently straightforward; all of which hopefully is enough for
 this application to become a healthy open source project.

 It is the web site of an open source project, with more than 100,000 visits
 per month and more than 700,000 pageviews per month, with traffic coming
 from all around the world.
 These fairly large numbers and the geographical spread of its visitors
 make it a good test case for measuring the effect of a CDN.

The goal was obviously to port this site to Drupal (which is not a part
 of this thesis of course) and to install the Episodes module.
 During about a week, statistics would be collected while no CDN was being
 used.
 Then, I would install the daemon on the server to sync the files to a CDN.
 Next, I would install the Drupal CDN integration module.
 Then again for about a week, statistics would be collected while the CDN
 was being used.
 Hopefully, by visualizing the collected episode measurements, it would
 be confirmed that this had indeed had a positive effect.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The web site was previously a combination of static HTML and a bit of PHP.
 On June 11, I launched the new web site, which was built using Drupal.
 Drupal's CSS and JavaScript aggregation options were enabled.
 Due to this, Drupal combines the CSS files for the same media type (
\family typewriter
screen
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
all
\family default
 …) and in the same section (header or footer) and the JavaScript file sin
 the same section (header or footer), thereby already significantly reducing
 the number of HTTP requests and page loading time.
 If I would have turned this on when enabling CDN integration, the effect
 would have been far more significant.
 But the comparison would have been unfair.
 Hence, these options were enabled, right from the beginning.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Also the JavaScript for the Google Analytics service has been cached on
 the web server since the launch of the web site, because the Google Analytics
 module for Drupal supports it.
 This makes it even harder to show the effect.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Finally, DriverPacks.net is a site with virtually no images (because it slows
 down the page loading, but mostly because I am not a designer).
 Only two images are loaded for the web site's style, one is loaded for
 each of the two statistics services and one is loaded for the ad at the
 top.
 Only the two images that are part of the web site's style can be cached.
 This makes it again more difficult to show the effect.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This suggests that the results that will be observed should be magnified
 significantly for more media-rich web sites, which is typically the case
 nowadays.
 However, I did not have such a web site around to test with.
 It is likely that if the effect is noticeable on this web site, it is dramatica
lly noticeable on a meda-rich web site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On June 21 around 2 AM GMT+1, I enabled CDN integration for all users.
 To show the potential of the daemon in combination with the CDN integration
 module however, I implemented the 
\family typewriter
cdn_advanced_pick_server()
\family default
 function that the Drupal CDN integration module calls when it is running
 in advanced mode and when that function exists.
 It really allows you to create any desired logic for routing users to specific
 CDNs or static file servers, as is demonstrated in listing
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both a static file server and a CDN are being used, but not just for demonstrati
ve purposes.
 It was decided to use two servers because the latency to SimpleCDN's servers
 is higher than acceptable in Europe (around 100 milliseconds or more).
 They claim to have servers in Amsterdam, but for some reason all requests
 from my IP (in Belgium) are being routed to a datacenter in Phoenix, Arizona
 in the United States, which explains the high latency (this was discovered
 using the 
\family typewriter
traceroute
\family default
 command).
 This was worse than 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 using a CDN for countries with low-latency connections to Belgium.
 Since latency is the major problem in the loading of CSS, JavaScript and
 other files referenced by the HTML (because of the multitude of round trips
 due to HTTP requests), I measured this using the 
\family typewriter
ping
\family default
 command.
 I mostly relied on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just ping
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 web service 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to get ping times from all around the world, to get a global view.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If only SimpleCDN would have been used, the web site would have become significa
ntly slower in Europe (also in Russia, but less dramatically) and it would
 have been very likely that no improvement could be observed from the collected
 statistics.

 Europe).
 Files served from this domain have gzip enabled, far future Expires headers

 There are other CDN services than SimpleCDN that provide POPs all over
 the world, as opposed to just two continents.
 They are typically far more expensive though.

 This module uses the database maintained by ARIN, the American Registry

 ARIN is one of the five official Regional Internet Registries (RIR) responsible
 for assigning IP addresses.
 It is claimed to be 98% accurate, which should be sufficiently accurate.
 Via the

), all country codes for Europe are collected in an array.
 Russia's country code is appended to this array.
 This way, all European countries plus Russia are assigned to the 'warp'
 server.
 Visitors from all other countries are assigned to the 'simplecdn' server.
 This implies that files are being synced through the daemon to both the
 'warp' server (using the symlink or copy transporter, see section

This means episode measurements have been collected since the beginning
 of June 11 until the beginning of June 25, resulting in exactly two weeks
 of data, with the last 4 days having CDN integration.

's visitors typically don't visit the site daily, but weekly or monthly.
 Hence many visitors have an empty cache, which drives the measured durations
 up.
 Fortunately, the effect of the CDN on visitors with an empty cache is clearly
 visible.
 The effect of visitors with primed caches is also visible, but less explicit.

Now the interesting part begins.
 There are five charts in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Episodes-analysis:-page"

\end_inset

.
 The first four display the average duration of the 
\family typewriter
backend
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
frontend
\family default
 episodes per day, for a given territory of visitors.
 The first chart gives the results for all collected data, i.e.
 globally.
 The second chart is for Brazil, the third for the Netherlands and the fourth
 for the United States.
 As we have seen, the United States and Brazil represent the largest groups
 of visitors, so their results should closely match the average real-world
 performance there, which means they should be well represented in these
 charts.
 The Netherlands were chosen because a location very close to the 'warp'
 server was also needed.
 The Netherlands were chosen over Belgium because more visitors originate
 from there, making the results more representative.
 On average, the U.S.
 had about 2,800 page views per day, Brazil had about 1,500 page views per
 day and the Netherlands had about 350 daily page views.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The fifth and last chart compares the average duration of the 
\family typewriter
frontend
\family default
 episodes per day of the three countries with the global averages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this bachelor thesis is not page rendering performance, but about page
 loading performance, the charted data for 
\family typewriter
backend
\family default
 episodes can be ignored.
 I have no explanation for why it peaks at different times around the world.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The 
\family typewriter
frontend
\family default
 episodes contain the durations of loading all CSS, JavaScript and images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the 
\family typewriter
frontend
\family default
 episode durations in the first four charts, it is clear that in the period
 from June 11 until June 21, the variability in page loading time was very
 large.
 This may suggest that measurements are not taken over enough page views
 from a global point of view, but in the case of the United States and Brazil,
 which both had more than 2,500 page views per day (which should be sufficient
 to cancel out anomalies), it suggests that the variability of network latency
 (due to distance or congestion) can be great.
 This can probably be explained by the fact that most files had to be retrieved
 from the web server in Belgium.
 Belgium is a long distance from Brazil and the United States and therefor
 there are more opportunities (at every hop along the route) for the latency
 to increase, which is possibly the reason for the large variability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting June 21, which is the date when CDN integration was enabled, there
 is a slight increase in some countries, but globally, there is a slight
 decrease.
 This is to be expected, as the frequent visitors have to download the static
 files again, this time from the CDN ('simplecdn' server) or static file
 server ('warp' server).
 On June 22, when another batch of changes was applied and the cached CSS
 and JavaScript files were once again obsolete, there is a slight increase
 globally, but a significant drop in the Netherlands.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It is likely that this is because whereas Dutch visitors previously had
 to wait for as much as five round trips to the United States (three to
 the 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

delicious.com
\end_layout

\end_inset

 servers, one to Google Analytics' server and one to the additional statistics
 service's server), that is now reduced to just three (the CSS and JavaScript
 files for the 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

delicious.com
\end_layout

\end_inset

 widget are being served from the CDN or, in the case of the Netherlands,
 from the static file server in Belgium).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

However, starting on June 23, there is a clear, worldwide, downward trend.
 Especially in Brazil and the United States, this trend is very prominently
 visible in the charts.
 It is less strong in the Netherlands, because they were getting their files
 already from a server with a fairly small latency.
 The reason it drops even further for the Netherlands likely is that the
 static file server is configured properly to maximize client-side caching
 (i.e.
 in the visitor's browser), whereas before the CDN and static file server
 were being used, static files were being served using the default Apache
 settings.

Finally, there is the analysis of the duration of the episodes (see figure

) themselves, regardless of country.
 Through this chart, it is possible to examine which episode have the greatest
 impact on the overal page loading time and would thus benefit the most
 from optimizations.
 Unfortunately, I did not have the time to create a chart that displays
 the evolution over time.
 So it is currently impossible to see how much a specific episode has improved
 over time.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

However, it is very clear that the 
\family typewriter
headerjs
\family default
 episode (which represents the episode of loading the JavaScript in the
 
\family typewriter
<head> 
\family default
element of the HTML document) is by far the episode with the longest duration,
 thus is the best candidate for optimization.
 Probably even after CDN integration, this episode will remain the longest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Globally, there has been a strong decrease in the page loading time and
 thus a strong increase in page loading performance.
 And since this test was conducted on a media-poor web site, it is likely
 that the effect is dramatically more noticeable on a media-rich web site.
 Since the downward trend lasted two days, it seems likely that the page
 loading time will become less variable because the static files have been
 cached in the browser.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Especially for countries that are located far from Belgium, such as Brazil
 and the United States, variability seems to have decreased significantly.
 This suggests that adding more servers around the world, at strategic locations
 (for example in the case of 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

DriverPacks.net
\end_layout

\end_inset

, Bangkok in Thailand is the city that generates the most visitors around
 the world according to Google Analytics), may be a very effective method
 for improving page loading performance.
 Depending on the web site, this strategy may achieve equal or better performanc
e than a CDN with servers all around the world, at a fraction of the cost.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is certain that every web site can benefit from an analysis like the
 one above.
 The strategy to optimize page loading performance is different for every
 web site.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this bachelor thesis is improving Drupal's page loading performance.
 But in order to guarantee that my attempted improvements to Drupal actually
 have an effect, I had to be able to measure the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After analyzing a broad set of page loading performance profiling tools
 (and related tools), it became clear that Episodes (which was written as
 a prototype by Steve Souders, whom can be considered the evangelizer of
 page loading performance) was the best candidate: it is the only one that
 is capable of measuring the real-world page loading performance, the results
 from the actual people using it.
 Furthermore, it has the most potential for becoming the standard profiling
 tool over the next few years and even to become integrated with future
 browsers.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So I polished the code, made it ready (or at least usable) for the real
 world and integrated it with Drupal: the Drupal Episodes module.
 The integration with Drupal happens in such a way that all Drupal behaviors
 (all JavaScript behaviors are defined using a standardized Drupal JavaScript
 API) are automatically measured.
 All that is needed, are a couple of changes to the theme to make the measuremen
ts cover all aspects.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This module is ready for use in production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I also made another Drupal module (the Episodes Server module) that is able
 to import the logs collected through Episodes and visualize the measurements
 through charts.
 Thanks to these charts, you can track the real-world page loading performance
 over time and even compare the page loading performance of multiple countries
 simultaneously with the global page loading performance.
 It also allows you to find out which episodes are the biggest bottlenecks
 for a better page loading time.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This module is not ready for production, but is a good base to start from.
 The code that imports the logs into the database is covered by unit tests.
 The code is licensed under the GPL and available at 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there is the daemon for syncing files, of course.
 This was the most important part of this thesis.
 As odd as it may seem, there seems to be nothing similar in existence,
 or at least not publicly available (not even commercially).
 If it did exist, I would surely have been informed by one of the tens of
 people who know about the concept of my bachelor thesis.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I started with the configuration file design.
 The configuration of the daemon happens through an XML file that is designed
 to be easy to use if you are familiar with the terminology.
 Several people who are familiar with the terminology were asked to look
 at it and immediately responded that it made sense.
 It is important that this is easy, because this is the interface to the
 daemon.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I decomposed the daemon into major components and started with the most
 simple one, because I was writing this in Python, a language that I had
 never used before, but was rumored to be extremely easy to program in —
 this ease was supposedly partially thanks to the availability of modules
 for nearly everything imaginable.
 Fortunately, that turned out to be the case, although I had been fearing
 for a long time that I had to write all the code for transporters myself
 — a near impossible challenge given the timeframe.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is why the daemon in fact is just a set of Python modules that can
 be used in any application.
 For example, in the case of the 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor.py
\family default
 module — which abstracts file system monitors on different operating systems,
 thereby creating a cross-platform API — it is certainly possible that it
 will be reused by other applications.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thus I wrote a fairly large set of Python modules: 
\family typewriter
config.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
daemon_thread_runner.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
filter.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor.py
\family default
 (with one subclass for every supported operating system), 
\family typewriter
pathscanner.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
persistent_list.py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
persistent_queue,py
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
processor.py
\family default
 (with a set of subclasses, one for each processor) and 
\family typewriter
transporter.py
\family default
 (with subclasses that are very thin wrappers around Django custom storage
 systems).
 Whenever feasible, I wrote unit tests.
 But because this application involves a lot of file I/O and network I/O
 due to its nature, this was often extremely hard and thus skipped.
 For 
\family typewriter
fsmonitor
\family default
 support in Linux, I was able to build upon the 
\family typewriter
pyinotify
\family default
 module and for the transporters, I was able to completely reuse Django's
 custom storage systems.
 All other modules are completely my own product.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This has an interesting side effect: 
\family typewriter
arbitrator.py
\family default
, the module that links all these stand-alone modules together into a single
 whole, i.e.
 which arbitrates between all different modules, can easily be refactored
 completely.
 While it is almost a thousand lines of code (albeit with a lot of comments),
 the code could easily be rewritten completely as part of a redesign, and
 you would only have to write the logic that links all modules together.
 This means that in a worst case scenario, for example, the daemon is found
 to have a bottleneck in a certain situation due to a design flaw, it can
 easily be adapted, because all the logic of the daemon itself is embedded
 in a single module.
 Only that part must be rewritten.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Because it is impossible to be sure that the daemon works correctly and
 reliably in every environment and with every possible configuration, it
 is recommended that a company first simulates its use case and verifies
 that the daemon works to its expectations.
 The code is licensed under the GPL and will be made available on a web
 site (but a name for the daemon has not yet been decided on).
 Hopefully, others will start contributing to it to improve it further to
 make it suitable for more situations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Drupal module for easy integration with CDNs was also written: the CDN
 integration module.
 However, I first had to write a patch for Drupal core, because it is necessary
 to be able to alter the URLs to files that are generated by default, because
 it is necessary to point them to the files on the CDN instead of those
 on the web server.
 A patch for Drupal 7 (which is currently in development), to make this
 functionality part of Drupal core in the future, has had very positive
 reviews, but must still go through the minutious peer review process and
 will likely soon get committed.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In the Drupal module, two modes are available: basic and advanced.
 In basic mode, it can only be used with Origin Pull CDNs.
 But because it now makes this very easy, whereas it previously required
 a lot of manual fiddling, this alone is a worthy addition to the Drupal
 contributed modules.
 However, in advanced mode, it becomes truly interesting: then it uses the
 synced files database generated by the daemon to rewrite file URLs.
 It is even possible to implement a special callback function which can
 be used to select a specific server to serve the files from based on properties
 of the visitor (location, membership type, anything).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This module is also ready for use in production.
 The code is licensed under the GPL and is available at

The feedback from companies was underwhelming in numbers but overwhelming
 in positivity.
 I could not have hoped for more positive feedback.
 The possibilities the daemon offers were strongly appreciated.
 The code structure of the daemon was described as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clear and self-explanatory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the documentation (of the daemon itself and my description of it in
 this thesis text) as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

very clear
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It even made a reviewer regret that he did not finish his own bachelor
 degree.
 This reviewer was even so enthusiastic that he already started writing
 patches for the daemon so that it would better suit his infrastructure.
 This suggests that it is feasible that the daemon will become a lively
 open source project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the results of my own testing case confirmed the thesis that integratin
g Drupal with a CDN could further improve the page loading performance.
 While the results (as logged via the Episodes module) were not as explicit
 as they could have been for a media-rich site (my test case was a media-poor
 web site), the difference was still clearly discernable in the charts (as
 generated by the Episodes Server module).
 Despite the fact that the web site had already been optimized with the
 mechanisms available in Drupal by default, integrating it with a CDN (via
 the CDN integration module and the daemon), clearly improved the overall,
 worldwide page loading performance.
