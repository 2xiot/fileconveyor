"""fsmonitor.py Cross-platform file system monitor

How it works:
- Uses inotify on Linux (kernel 2.6 and higher) (TODO) => use pyinotify
- Uses FileSystemWatcher on Windows (TODO)
- Uses FSEvents on Mac OS X (10.5 and higher)
- Falls back to manual scanning (TODO)

A persistent mode is also supported, in which all metadata is stored in a
database. This allows you to even track changes when your program wasn't
running.

Only FSEvents supports looking back in time. For Linux and Windows this means
that the manual scanning procedure will be used instead until we have caught
up.

To make this class work consistently, less critical features that are only
available for specific file system monitors are abstracted away. And other
features are emulated.
This implies that the following features are not available through FSMonitor:
- inotify:
  * auto_add: is always assumed to be True (FSEvents has no setting for this)
  * recursive: is always assumed to be True (FSEvents has no setting for this)
  * IN_ACCESS, IN_CLOSE_WRITE, IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE, IN_OPEN, IN_DELETE_SELF and
    IN_IGNORED event aren't supported (FSEvents doesn't support this)
  * IN_UNMOUNT is also not supported because FSEvents' equivalent
    (kFSEventStreamEventFlagUnmount) isn't supported in Python
- FSEvents:
  * sinceWhen: is always set to kFSEventStreamEventIdSinceNow (inotify has no
    setting for this)
  * kFSEventStreamEventFlagMount: is ignored (inotify doesn't support this)
And the following features are emulated:
- FSEvents:
  * inotify's mask, which allows you to listen only to certain events
Finally, the manual scanning implementation only supports a limited number of
events: CREATED, MODIFIED and DELETED. This is for performance reasons.
