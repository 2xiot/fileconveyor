Basic mode
----------
- Instead of just allowed extensions, allow to also filter by minimum/maximum
  file size.

Advanced mode
-------------
- Build in mechanisms to allow the file to be served from a specific server
  (that can be either a CDN or a static file server), based on the user's
  properties (location, membership, â€¦). For now, we just use the first URL.
