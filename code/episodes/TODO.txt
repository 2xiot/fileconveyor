TODO:
- filters for the reports: (POSTPONED)
   1) time (last six months, last month, last week, today)
   2) browser
   3) URL (wildcard matching)
- display average page load time per continent, zoom, avg page load time per
  country, zoom, per city (POSTPONED)
- Encourage module developers to use Drupal.Episodes' lazy loading mechanism
  (POSTPONED)

Problems-that-need-thought:
- time zone handling: necessary or not (for the ingestor)? I.e. should the ingestor convert it to GMT or not?
- how can the server know how to categorize/associate certain episodes
  (my use case: Drupal.behaviors), because the server is not necessarily on
  the same web server as Drupal?

Drupal core ideas:
- Not only provide Drupal.behaviors, but Drupal.transformations (carousel etc,
  these MUST be in HEAD) and Drupal.lazy (can be in footer).
