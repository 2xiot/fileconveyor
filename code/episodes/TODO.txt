Questions for Steve Souders:
- Why hardcode the domain name in window.postMessage() calls when you could also just use document.location?
- Why hardcode scriptUrl? It should be in EPISODES.compatScriptUrl?
- Should the first byte always be measured explicitly?
  http://stevesouders.com/episodes/episodes.js suggests you shouldn't: it estimates the start time based on a cookie â€“ BUT WHAT WITH THE FIRST TIME?
  http://stevesouders.com/episodes/example.php suggests you should measure it explicitly.
  But firstbyte only starts measuring from the front-end. I also want to measure
  the back-end. So I'm now setting EPISODES.backendStartTime from the back-end.
- Is http://stevesouders.com/episodes/episodes.js released under the GPL or the public domain?
- Should a domready event (besides the pageready) episode be added to episodes.js?
- "beacon" is an odd term and therefor "beacon URL" too. Can't we switch to "logging URL"?



Problems-that-need-thought:
- Handle dev/staging/production.
- Encourage module developers to support EPISODES when present. Should degrade gracefully.
  -> lazy loading callbacks
  -> own episodes
  -> separate logs because they're not entire page load sequences?
- On the first page load, the cookie is not yet set and therefor the pageready,
  backend and totaltime times cannot be calculated. Also a problem when cookies are disabled
- time zone handling: necessary or not (for the ingestor)
- Display average page load time per continent, zoom, avg page load time per country, zoom, per city



Know-how-to-do-but-not-yet-done:
- Move the ingestor + charts to a separate module: episodes_server.module
- Charts


Drupal core ideas:
- Not only provide Drupal.behaviors, but Drupal.transformations (carousel etc) and Drupal.lazy.
