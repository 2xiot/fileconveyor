Questions for Steve Souders:
- Why hardcode the domain name in window.postMessage() calls when you could also just use document.location?
- Why hardcode scriptUrl? It should be in EPISODES.compatScriptUrl?
- Should the first byte always be measured explicitly?
  http://stevesouders.com/episodes/episodes.js suggests you shouldn't: it estimates the start time based on a cookie â€“ BUT WHAT WITH THE FIRST TIME?
  http://stevesouders.com/episodes/example.php suggests you should measure it explicitly.
  But firstbyte only starts measuring from the front-end. I also want to measure
  the back-end. So I'm now setting EPISODES.backendStartTime from the back-end.
- Is http://stevesouders.com/episodes/episodes.js released under the GPL or the public domain?
- Should a domready event (besides the pageready) episode be added to episodes.js?
- "beacon" is an odd term and therefor "beacon URL" too. Can't we switch to "logging URL"?

TODO:
- filters for the reports: (POSTPONED)
   1) time (last six months, last month, last week, today)
   2) browser
   3) URL (wildcard matching)
- Encourage module developers to use Drupal.Episodes' lazy loading mechanism (POSTPONED)

Problems-that-need-thought:
- On the first page load, the cookie is not yet set and therefor the pageready,
  backend and totaltime times cannot be calculated. Also a problem when cookies are disabled
- time zone handling: necessary or not (for the ingestor)? I.e. should the ingestor convert it to GMT or not?
- how can the server know how to categorize/associate certain episodes (my use case: Drupal.behaviors)

Drupal core ideas:
- Not only provide Drupal.behaviors, but Drupal.transformations (carousel etc, these MUST be in HEAD) and Drupal.lazy (can be in footer).
